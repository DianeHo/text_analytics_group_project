3 月 20 日消息，据韩国媒体 SisaJournal 的报道，苹果计划在其今年发布的
系列手机中采用全新的超窄边框技术，以实现更大尺寸的显示屏。

这种名为“Border Reduction Structure (BRS)”的技术通过将内部铜线卷成更紧凑的结构来缩小手机底部显示屏的边框宽度。据报道，苹果计划将这项技术应用于所有四款即将于今年下半年发布的
16 机型。
据称，苹果此前曾尝试在 iPhone 中应用这项技术，但由于散热问题而搁置。由于散热技术取得了新进展，苹果再次致力于采用 BRS 技术。
去年，苹果使用了一种名为“低压注塑成型 (LIPO)”的技术成功缩小了
机型的边框宽度，使其达到了 1.5 毫米（
为 2.2 毫米）。
IT之家注意到，自 2020 年推出 iPhone 12 系列以来，苹果的 iPhone 屏幕尺寸一直没有明显的变化。不过，iPhone 16 系列将改变这一现状，据悉
机型的显示屏尺寸将比
Pro 机型的更大。
据报道，iPhone 16 Pro 和
的显示屏尺寸分别将增加到约 6.3 英寸和 6.9 英寸。确切地来说，iPhone 16 Pro 的显示屏尺寸为 6.27 英寸，而 iPhone 16 Pro Max 的显示屏尺寸为 6.85 英寸。
显示屏尺寸的增加也将导致机身尺寸的增大，iPhone 16 Pro 和 16 Pro Max 将会比前代机型略微高一点宽一点。更大的机身将为苹果提供更多内部空间容纳其他组件，例如 iPhone 16 Pro 系列可能会配备更大容量的电池。
预计 iPhone 16 和
的尺寸将与 iPhone 15 和
相同，不过苹果有望在 2025 年发布的 iPhone 17 和 iPhone 17 Plus 上也采用更大的 6.27 英寸和 6.86 英寸显示屏。

It remains to be seen how upping the peaks will affect actual charging time for both technologies on these phones, since that's what people care about the most. Still, if this pans out (and that's a big

It's the truth. Sensor size only affects the low-light performance (no. of photons captured, hence dynamic range). The test involved sufficient light. It's not low-light or dynamic range test.
Iphone 16 series sux. The company is failing to innovate. Camera is full of marketing BS.

My point on that channel still stands, I can't stand them. Watch their other rants on other brands. Sorry.
Following his review methodology, 24mp APS-c sensors aren't true 24MP cos it's not comparable to his full frame.
There isn't a benchmark to say 12mp or 48mp must have x amount of details. The sensor is trying to catch as much info at the largest megapixel count that it can.
And like I said, no reasonable person would expect 48mp from a tiny sensor to compare with one from a larger sensor, that's just physics.
I will agree with you, apple really needs to buck up on innovation.

Even more surprising was that I tried my luck by clicking the “Add eSIM” and scan the original Singtel eSIM activation QR code from mid August, the original Singtel eSIM activated. I tested calling out, receiving calls and mobile data from the eSIM and they all worked.

2) Is it based on the date the phone is delivered to me?
3) Is it based on my purchase date on Shopee?

For 16pm, kinda like the tactile feeling of the side button for camera, but hope in the future got more functions for it. Old phone to new phone data xfer was a breeze- but hated it when both watches cannot be paired to new phone automatically after the xfer.
Old watch U2- unpaired, reset to factory settings and forced to perform mandatory upgrade before it can be paired with 16pm. Fortunately there is an option to reset while retaining the watch plan. After pairing is done, mobile share is still retained.
Old watch S6- this one jialat no matter what i do, cannot pair up with the new phone (pairing failure msg). End up have to use an older 14pm to perform the above, make sure its watch OS is the latest, unpair it again before the new 16pm can be paired with it. Bonkers for spending so much time on this.
Btw 16pm and 15pm, not much difference in terms of wifi, 5g (esim) speed. Can easily hit 800-1000+ wirelessly. Other functionality same same performance as well.
iOS 18.2 hopefully won't be as buggy on my phone as mentioned by others.
No love no hate for this phone- next year recon again
Bill was $297 today for the recon, hope it stays similar year after year

It's a very important update for
owners as it should finally include the long-promised changes to Siri. This will include the ability for Apple's digital assistant to tap into your personal data to provide better answer to your queries. In its promotional
, Apple says that Siri will also have richer language understanding, more natural communication, and the ""ability to take action in and across apps.""
Gurman does say that this will not put Siri on the same level as the most advanced voice assistants out there, though integration with
should help with that regard. It is, however, an important update for Apple, which unveiled a suite of
features last June, but still hasn't gotten to launching them all yet.
