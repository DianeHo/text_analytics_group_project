as the next generation of the wireless charging standard that many devices use, but only now are the first Qi2 devices actually coming. Plus, it’s looking like Google is preparing Qi2 for the next Pixel release.
In a
today, the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) announced that the first Qi2 productions are “completing” certification testing now. This means that Qi2 devices will be hitting the market very soon, acting as the official launch of the standard.
Qi2’s main selling point of the addition of the “Magentic Power Profile,” the generic name for Apple’s MagSafe. The technology will make its way to more and more devices as the standard is more widely adopted. The magnets will also be the only real difference that consumers see, as the WPC notes that any products that adopt the new Qi v2.0 Extended Power Profile (EPP) but
do not
adopt magnets will not show the new Qi2 logo.
Qi2 will still provide 15W rates for charging, but it should be faster in practice thanks to the use of magnets to perfectly align the coils.
Some of the first Qi2 products will be accessories from brands such as Anker, Belkin, and others. There’s still no word on the first Qi2 certified smartphones, though that will likely be the iPhone 15 series.
.
However, it’s looking like Google won’t be too slow to adopt Qi2 in the Pixel lineup. As noted
, Google’s Liyu Yang has joined the WPC as a board member
. Yang has been working on wireless charging tech for Pixel phones including both iterations of the Pixel Stand and the use of Qi on the Pixel 6 Pro. Liyu’s LinkedIn profile
that he is a “Power Specialist” at Google and has been with the company since 2017, previously working on power systems for Apple.
While there’s no direct confirmation that Google Pixel 9 will adopt Qi2, the WPC’s post directly references “future Pixel products” for including “next-generation wireless charging.”
Of course, Google’s potential use of Qi2 in a Pixel 9 would be far from the first device to adopt the tech. Prior to Google’s usual October launches, we’ll see the Samsung Galaxy S24 series, new Galaxy foldables, the OnePlus 12, and a plethora of other smartphone launches where Qi2 is not only possible, but highly likely.",qi2 next generation wireless charging standard many devices use first qi2 devices actually coming plus looking like google preparing qi2 next pixel release today wireless power consortium wpc announced first qi2 productions completing certification testing means qi2 devices hitting market soon acting official launch standard qi2s main selling point addition magentic power profile generic name apples magsafe technology make way devices standard widely adopted magnets also real difference consumers see wpc notes products adopt new qi v20 extended power profile ep not adopt magnets not show new qi2 logo qi2 still provide 15w rates charging faster practice thanks use magnets perfectly align coils first qi2 products accessories brands anker belkin others theres still no word first qi2 certified smartphones though likely iphone 15 series however looking like google wont slow adopt qi2 pixel lineup noted googles liyu yang joined wpc board member yang working wireless charging tech pixel phones including iterations pixel stand use qi pixel 6 pro liyus linkedin profile power specialist google company since 2017 previously working power systems apple theres no direct confirmation google pixel 9 adopt qi2 wpcs post directly references future pixel products including nextgeneration wireless charging course googles potential use qi2 pixel 9 would far first device adopt tech prior googles usual october launches well see samsung galaxy s24 series new galaxy foldables oneplus 12 plethora smartphone launches qi2 not possible highly likely

(Image credit: Tom's Guide)
There’s little doubt that Google won’t continue releasing two flagship Pixels towards the end of the year — presumably October. But one leak has suggested
: the standard Pixel 9 and two Pixel 9 Pro variants.
Apparently these two variants will share all the same performance and camera improvements, but will come in two different sizes. One with a traditional 6.7-inch display and another with a 6.3-inch screen. Of course a separate rumor claims that we’ll get the usual pair of phones, though
. It wasn’t specified how much larger they might get, though.
Whatever happens, we can expect the entire Pixel 9 series to come with a Tensor G4 chipset. We don’t expect this to be a particularly powerful chip, though it would be nice if Google managed to boost the efficiency by a noticeable degree. Instead this is what’s going to power the Pixel 9’s AI features which will likely have a heavy focus on photo quality and additional editing skills.
We also expect that Google will be leaning heavily on its own AI models. It’s been confirmed that
, which will be accessible through Google Assistant. So far these features have only been confirmed to improve existing Pixel AI features, but we’d offer pretty good odds that new and more powerful features are coming.
Beyond AI we should also expect to see general improvements to the Pixel 9 camera and display, while we hope Google can avoid the usual

HIGHLIGHTS
New 5K renders give us a close look at the vanilla Google Pixel 9.

In addition to Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, Google will also launch Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Google Pixel 9 will offer a flat frame and a rear camera bump that houses two sensors.



In January, 91mobiles and MySmartPrice published renders of the

, respectively, courtesy of well-known tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer aka OnLeaks. Steve has now informed us that those devices were actually the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Yes, Google will be launching an ‘XL’ version this year, bringing it back for the first time since the Pixel 5 series. With that in mind, we now bring you an exclusive first look at the vanilla Pixel 9.
Google Pixel 9 design details​
There’s a total of four 5K renders and a 360-degree video of the Pixel 9 that give us a good look at upcoming Google flagship.

The design is similar to the Pixel 9 Pro, with a compact body and thick rear camera module. But it’s a dual-camera setup on the Pixel 9 as opposed to a triple-camera system on the Pro model.

The Pixel 9 will have rounded corners with a flat display and a centered punch-hole selfie camera. The power button and volume keys are placed on the right side of a flat frame. The smartphone will feature a 6.03-inch display, slightly smaller than the Pixel 9 Pro’s 6.1-inch display.

In terms of dimensions, the Pixel 9 measures around 152.8 x 71.9 x 8.5mm, and 12mm with the rear camera bump, OnLeaks tells us.

The Pixel 9 here is seen in a Black colour similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google will most likely launch the Pixel 9 in other colour options. It looks like Google is going for a design change with the Pixel 9 series, making it look similar to the iPhone 15 and even the Galaxy S24 series.

It's important to note that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are identical in size, but the Pixel 9 has larger bezels than the 9 Pro. Moreover, all three phones get 120Hz AMOLED.
Cameras:
Pixel 9: 0.5x, 1x

Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL: 0.5x, 1x, 5x (all three cameras are 50 MP)

All three phones run on Google Tensor G4 (name not confirmed), we will publish information about the processor later.
Now we can only note that the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have UWB, the Pixel 9 does not.
It won't be possible without changes to the design either. The main innovation is the redesigned camera unit, which no longer extends from edge to edge, as was the case with the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro. At the same time, the new smartphones have a flat back panel and a flat screen. The previous generation had it with roundings. The side edges are now also completely flat.
Size comparison between Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro:
Size comparison between Pixel 9 Pro XL and iPhone 15 Pro Max:
We also have comparison photos of Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9, Pixel 8 and Pixel 7 - definitely, Pixel 9 / 9 Pro are larger in size than Pixel 8, but comparable to Pixel 7.
In addition, the Pro versions received a matte “back” and glossy frames (at the same time, the camera block remained matte). Pixel 9, on the contrary, received a glossy “back” and matte frames.
We will try to publish some more exclusive materials about the new Pixels in the near future. They can be officially announced as early as May 14 at Google I/O.

We continue to share exclusive details about the new Pixel 9 series smartphones. Previously, an anonymous source
Rozetked with photos of the new devices, and now we have received benchmark test results.
As you know, all new Google flagships will receive the latest proprietary Tensor G4 chipset. Based on benchmark results, performance varies depending on the phone model, but all Pixel 9s use a chip with the same specifications.
Characteristics of Google Tensor G4 (ARMv9-A architecture):
1×Cortex-X4 (3.1 GHz)

3×Cotrex-A720 (2.6 GHz)

4×Cortex-A520 (1.95 GHz)

Characteristics of Google Tensor G3 (ARMv9-A architecture) for comparison:
1×Cortex-X3 (2.91 GHz)

4×Cortex-A715 (2.37 GHz)

4×Cortex-A510 (1.7 GHz)

The original Tensor and G2 had a 2+2+4 core configuration, while the G3 went to 1+4+4. Here’s the historical comparison:

Tensor
Tensor G2
Tensor G3
Tensor G4
2x Cortex-X1 (2.8 GHz)
2x Cortex-X1 (2.85 GHz)
1x Cortex-X3 (2.91 GHz)
1x Cortex-X4 (3.1 GHz)
2x Cortex-A76 (2.25 GHz)
2x Cortex-A78 (2.35 GHz)
4x Cortex-A715 (2.37 GHz)
3x Cortex-A720 (2.6 GHz)
4x Cortex-A55 (1.8 GHz)
4x Cortex-A55 (1.8 GHz)
4x Cortex-A510 (1.7 GHz)
4x Cortex-A520 (1.95 GHz)
As you can see, there are several key changes compared to Google Tensor G3. Firstly, the new chip has lost one core and is an 8-core solution. Secondly, the G4 is capable of operating at higher frequencies. The main Cortex-X3 core was replaced with X4.
Now let's move on to the tests.
Pixel 9 AnTuTu results:
Pixel 9 (Tokay) – 1.07 million points

Pixel 9 Pro (Caiman) – 1.14 million points

Pixel 9 Pro XL (Komodo) – 1.17 million points

The base Pixel 8 scores about 900,000 points in AnTuTu, which means that the performance gain for the Pixel 9 still looks very modest.

It is important to note that there is still quite a long wait before the release of new smartphones and Google engineers can carry out optimizations to get the most out of the new processor.

The Google Pixel 9 series will reportedly be equipped with Samsung’s M14 OLED screens.

By contrast, the Galaxy S24 series apparently shipped with older, M13 displays.

The new screen tech could result in the Pixel 9 range having brighter, long-lasting displays.

Google confirmed that it will announce the Pixel 9 series in August, and we’ve already seen plenty of reports and leaks about the new phones. The leak train isn’t stopping any time soon, as a Korean outlet has now revealed some apparent screen details.
Samsung Display is supplying Google and Apple with M14 OLED screens for the Pixel 9 series and iPhone 16 Pro models respectively, ET News reported (h/t: Phandroid). The outlet specifically mentioned that three Pixel 9 models and the Pixel Fold 2 will get the new display tech.
M14 would be the latest display material for Samsung’s OLED screens, with the Galaxy S24 series apparently using M13 screens. M14 has the best brightness and lifespan, according to the outlet. Previous display materials have also offered improved power efficiency.
This all suggests that the Pixel 9 series could theoretically have brighter, longer-lasting, and/or more efficient displays than the Galaxy S24 series.
Newer display material isn’t a sure-fire guarantee of brighter Pixel 9 screens, though.

series is set to bring even more intricate AI experiences.
Thanks to a source inside Google,
Android Authority
has learned that Google is planning to introduce a set of new ML features under the branding of “Google AI,” including a feature resembling Microsoft’s controversial
.
“Google AI at its best”​



Google AI will include a mix of new and existing features. Circle to Search is already available on Pixels and even select third-party devices, and
is available on all Android phones.
There are three completely new features, though: the first is
Add Me
, which claims to ensure everyone’s in a group photo. While we have no extra information about the feature, it sounds like an upgraded version of
,
which can not only change the expressions of people in a photo but also merge takes with different people in them. Best Take was first introduced with the Pixel 8 series, and while controversial, it’s still nice to have. Add Me shows Google wants to lean further into the idea that it matters what you’re photographing and not what you actually photographed, and that it thinks AI might be the solution for this problem.
Google is wrapping new and existing features under the Google AI banner for the Pixel 9.
Another new feature is
Studio
. We believe it’s the same Creative Assistant app
. The previous references we found reveal the app will integrate into the Pixels’ screenshot editor app, allowing it to create (“remix”) stickers.
The description from the screenshot above makes it seem like the app can do a lot more than just create stickers, though. It could be an all-in-one generative AI image generator, similar to
. It’s worth mentioning that Google has been working on its own image- and even video-generating models for a while. If you want to try them for yourself,
lets anyone try the Google Imagen 2 model and
(currently in closed beta) extends the capability to video. It will definitely be interesting to see how Google integrates Studio into other apps.
Last, and perhaps the most interesting feature, is
Pixel Screenshots
.
Bringing Recall to Android with Pixel Screenshots​





Pixel Screenshots is a feature closely resembling Microsoft’s controversial Recall feature. For those of you who have not had internet access for the past month, Recall is a Windows 11 feature that will be exclusive to the new
. It automatically captures everything you’re doing and uses on-device AI to let you quickly find information from whatever you are looking for. However, many people criticized the feature because of the privacy implications, especially after it was revealed that any attacker with access to your machine could read everything stored by the feature, and Microsoft paused the rollout while it irons out these issues.
Google’s take on the feature is different and more privacy-focused: instead of automatically capturing everything you’re doing, it will only work on screenshots you take yourself. When you do that, the app will add a bit of extra metadata to it, like app names, web links, etc. After that, it will be processed by a local AI, presumably the new
, which will let you search for specific screenshots just by their contents, as well as ask a bot questions about them.
Google's Recall-like feature only applies to screenshots you manually capture, making it more secure.
My take on the feature is that it’s definitely a better implementation of the idea than what Microsoft created. While there is a difference in functionality, both of the apps ultimately serve a similar purpose and Google’s implementation doesn’t easily leak sensitive information, at least. It will be interesting to see how it works in practice.
It’s worth mentioning Motorola is also working on

limmk,2024-07-04T21:31:29+0800,"Google Pixels haven’t always been perfect, occasionally suffering fundamental issues that persist throughout several generations. Some of the best-known examples included the use of outdated camera sensors, lack of ultrawide cameras, no uniform bezels, and extremely slow charging speeds.
Thankfully, Google eventually addressed all of those examples. The
is set to fix another long-lasting Pixel problem — the slightly slow and sometimes unreliable under-display fingerprint sensor. Thanks to a source familiar with the matter,
Android Authority
has learned that Google plans to use an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in its upcoming devices.
Upgrading to ultrasonic​



Edgar Cervantes / Android Authority
Google first switched to under-display fingerprint scanners with the Pixel 6 — before that, it has always used traditional rear-mounted sensors. Unfortunately, the switch went rather poorly — early users reported issues both with
. While the subsequent OTA updates and the next generations of Pixels somewhat improved the situation, unlocking was still comparatively slow, and it remains that way to this day.
The source of these problems was the choice of fingerprint scanner used. Google opted for an optical scanner from a company called Goodix, while the competitors have been using ultrasonic scanners. Optical scanners are typically slower, less accurate, and more sensitive to any moisture or dirt you might have on your finger. There’s also the issue of usage in low-light environments — optical scanners require the screen to flash a very bright light in the place of the scanner, which means if you don’t cover the circle on the screen completely, you might get hit with a flash of blinding light.
An ultrasonic fingerprint scanner should make unlocking faster and more reliable.
With the Pixel 9, Google is finally making the switch to an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. The specific unit used is Qualcomm’s 3D Sonic Gen 2 (QFS4008) — the same exact model as the
. The fingerprint scanners on Samsung devices have been excellent for a while now, so this is good news.
While the overall unlock experience and speed rely on more than just the hardware, an ultrasonic sensor is always going to be better than an optical sensor.

The new ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is coming to all the variants of the Pixel 9, except the Fold, which keeps its fingerprint scanner in the power button. Google has confirmed that the Pixel 9 series will

Here's a preview of the August Pixel Event
Google, like many others making
, slightly tweaks its camera bump design every year. Now that smartphones are mature devices, there are only so many ways to change the design of a slab year in and year out. However, by changing the camera bump, companies like Google, Samsung, and Apple can make the newest model of smartphones immediately recognizable by their design. It makes the latest devices feel fresh, and it also serves as something of a status symbol. People know you have the newest device by spotting the refreshed camera bump.
It's a slippery slope. Change isn't always good, and change just for the sake of change is usually bad. The rumored Pixel 9 camera bar looks to be a step backward in terms of design and functionality, and that's unfortunate.
The Pixel camera bar is probably changing shape​
Leaks suggest the camera bump will be an island on the back of the Pixel 9​

Leaks suggested that Google would alter the Pixel 9 camera bump, but those leaks were seemingly confirmed when a video of the new design popped up on X (formerly Twitter). Many were captivated by the hot pink colorway that would be a first for Google. The company often uses muted, pastel colors on its Pixel devices, and the pink colorway is a change of pace. However, the more striking design change can be viewed on the camera bump.
The last two generations of Pixel phones — the Pixel 7 series and Pixel 8 series — featured camera bars with glass windows for the lenses surrounded by metal. You'd have to go back to the Pixel 6 series to see a Pixel phone with an all-glass camera bar. With the upcoming Pixel 9 series, Google might blend the two design languages. The leaked video suggests the Pixel 9 camera will have a nearly all-glass design on the left side of the bump but a nearly all-metal design on the right side.
Few phones today feature the kind of design that the Pixel 9 is rumored to feature. The iPhone 15 Pro Max has individual camera lenses outlined with a titanium border and situated above a glass slab. The Galaxy S24 Ultra similarly features lenses bordered with metal, but those cameras are smaller and sit right atop the rear casing. The metal and glass accents on those two flagships make the camera housings pop with contrast and variety, and the same can be said about the Pixel 8 series. That's all being tossed aside for the Pixel 9 camera bump design if the leaks are to be believed.
Why the Pixel 9 camera bump looks weird​
It's too thick and doesn't look contiguous​



To be fair, these are leaks, and we don't know for sure what the Pixel 9 camera bump will look like. However, there's a good chance this video actually depicts the Pixel 9 camera. If that's the case, the new camera bar design looks weird, and there are a few reasons why. I find the design jarring because the camera bar looks
almost
symmetrical — it appears to be about 60% glass and lenses and 40% metal and flash.
Asymmetrical designs are fine, and in fact, most Pixel camera bumps aren't centered or symmetrical. But it's worse when something is so close to being symmetrical and isn't.
that human beings prefer symmetry, and because the Pixel 9 camera bump is nearly symmetrical, it looks like a mistake rather than an intentional design choice. Whereas on the Pixel 8 Pro, for example, the cameras are offset enough to the left that it looks intentional.
There are other oddities about this design. Why is the right side of the camera bump so large if it's only housing the flash? I'm sure there's some component under there, but it just looks strange to have the aluminum part of the camera bar so large. In my opinion, it would look better if there was a bit of aluminum on the left and right sides of the lenses. That would make it a bit more visually appealing and make it look like one contiguous part. It's hard to tell for sure from the video, but the camera bar looks very thick — like it protrudes too much from the body of the smartphone.
Another thing to consider is that the current Pixel camera bars feature metal that surrounds the camera lenses to protect them from scratches. The glass portion is slightly recessed under the metal, so the metal part of the camera bump will hit surfaces first. It's unclear whether the Pixel 9 will retain this characteristic, but based on the limited amount of aluminum surrounding the glass lens covering, it seems unlikely. Put it all together, and the Pixel 9 camera bump simply looks bad and might be less functional.
Google should've mimicked the Pixel Fold bar​
It's the best Pixel camera bar we've seen yet​



I love what Google has done with its Pixel camera housings over the years. The camera ""bar"" design makes Pixels immediately recognizable across generations, and it serves a functional purpose. Pixels can lay flat on a desk or table without rocking back and forth, thanks to the flat and long camera bar. This is an underrated part of the Pixel design language that particularly benefits people who don't use cases on their phones. That's why I'm disappointed that the Pixel 9 camera bar might be taking a step backward in terms of visual appeal.
The Pixel 9 cameras seem to take some design cues from the
, and that's not a bad thing. I think the Pixel Fold camera bar is the most attractive of any Google design, and it should bring more of that style to the Pixel 9. Unfortunately, Google probably isn't going that route, and the Pixel 9 will look a lot worse than the Pixel 8 as a result.",google holding hardware event early year expecting see pixel 9 series debut next month company pushed annual release schedule try get ahead leaks move not work numerous leaked details renders pixel 9 come past weeks leading algeria signs pointing one noticeable thing likely offer redesigned camera bump related heres preview august pixel event google like many others making slightly tweaks camera bump design every year smartphones mature devices many ways change design slab year year however changing camera bump companies like google samsung apple make newest model smartphones immediately recognizable design makes latest devices feel fresh also serves something status symbol people know newest device spotting refreshed camera bump slippery slope change not always good change sake change usually bad rumored pixel 9 camera bar looks step backward terms design functionality unfortunate pixel camera bar probably changing shape leaks suggest camera bump island back pixel 9 lightbox_close close lightbox_next next lightbox_previous previous lightbox_eror requested content not loaded please try later lightbox_start_slideshow start slideshow lightbox_stop_slideshow stop slideshow lightbox_ful_scren full screen lightbox_thumbnails thumbnails lightbox_download download lightbox_share share lightbox_zom zoom lightbox_new_window new window lightbox_togle_sidebar toggle sidebar leaks suggested google would alter pixel 9 camera bump leaks seemingly confirmed video new design popped x formerly twitter many captivated hot pink colorway would first google company often uses muted pastel colors pixel devices pink colorway change pace however striking design change viewed camera bump last two generations pixel phones pixel 7 series pixel 8 series featured camera bars glass windows lenses surrounded metal would go back pixel 6 series see pixel phone alglas camera bar upcoming pixel 9 series google might blend two design languages leaked video suggests pixel 9 camera nearly alglas design left side bump nearly almetal design right side phones today feature kind design pixel 9 rumored feature iphone 15 pro max individual camera lenses outlined titanium border situated glass slab galaxy s24 ultra similarly features lenses bordered metal cameras smaller sit right atop rear casing metal glass accents two flagships make camera housings pop contrast variety said pixel 8 series tossed aside pixel 9 camera bump design leaks believed pixel 9 camera bump looks weird thick not look contiguous fair leaks not know sure pixel 9 camera bump look like however good chance video actually depicts pixel 9 camera case new camera bar design looks weird reasons find design jarring camera bar looks almost symmetrical appears 60 glass lenses 40 metal flash asymmetrical designs fine fact pixel camera bumps not centered symmetrical worse something close symmetrical not human beings prefer symmetry pixel 9 camera bump nearly symmetrical looks like mistake rather intentional design choice whereas pixel 8 pro example cameras offset enough left looks intentional oddities design right side camera bump large housing flash sure component looks strange aluminum part camera bar large opinion would look better bit aluminum left right sides lenses would make bit visually appealing make look like one contiguous part hard tell sure video camera bar looks thick like protrudes much body smartphone another thing consider current pixel camera bars feature metal surrounds camera lenses protect scratches glass portion slightly recessed metal metal part camera bump hit surfaces first unclear whether pixel 9 retain characteristic based limited amount aluminum surrounding glass lens covering seems unlikely put together pixel 9 camera bump simply looks bad might less functional google mimicked pixel fold bar best pixel camera bar seen yet love google done pixel camera housings years camera bar design makes pixels immediately recognizable across generations serves functional purpose pixels lay flat desk table without rocking back forth thanks flat long camera bar underrated part pixel design language particularly benefits people not use cases phones disappointed pixel 9 camera bar might taking step backward terms visual appeal pixel 9 cameras seem take design cues not bad thing think pixel fold camera bar attractive google design bring style pixel 9 unfortunately google probably not going route pixel 9 look lot worse pixel 8 result

The GaN I use only does 30w at max for the phone because that's the highest that the phone supports via PD. And I'm gonna be real here, it's not that much different from using the 90w charger.
The only time fast charging actually matters is when your phones battery is already VERY low like 20-30% and you need to top it off FAST before you have to leave the house/office in 15 mins. Only then the charging will start force feeding juice into the phone, and the phone will accept it up til a certain point then it starts to slow.",xm14 user 90w charging nice honestly overrated lot marketing hypes majority time charge plugging standard 140w gan charger instead proprietary 90w charger came phone gan use 30w max phone highest phone supports via pd gon na real not much different using 90w charger time fast charging actually matters phones battery already low like 2030 need top fast leave houseofice 15 mins charging start force feeding juice phone phone accept til certain point starts slow

Loser,2024-07-25T21:08:04+0800,"[Exclusive] Google Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro Fold promo material reveals design, specs, AI, and other features​


There have been numerous leaks and rumours about the Pixel 9 series, but this newly leaked promo material acquired by 91mobiles courtesy
Steve Hemmerstoffer (OnLeaks) could be the most accurate representation. We are bringing to you the marketing images of the Google Pixel 9 series including the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro Fold which showcase the new design, specifications, AI and other features of the new Pixels.
Google Pixel 9 series design, colours​
Pixel 9 series comes in new colours like
dark grey, light grey, off-white (rumoured to be called Porcelain White), and pink
.

The sides are
polished
or glossy while the back panel is soft
matte
.

The new camera island gives these phones a distinct look. This island appears to have an obvious protrusion from the back panel. The Pro models could have three lenses and the regular Pixel could have two lenses. More on the sensors later.
The camera island is shaped like a rectangle with rounded corners on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. On the non-foldable (Pixel 9), it is oblong-shaped.

The front side has a punch hole cutout for the selfie snapper. The surrounding bezels also look negligible.

Pixel 9 vs Pixel 9 Pro vs Pixel 9 Pro Fold specifications​
Screen size:
The Pixel 9 has a 6.3-inch Actua display, the Pixel 9 Pro has a 6.3-inch and the XL model has a 6.8-inch Super Actua display. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a 6.3-inch Actua Front (cover screen) and an 8-inch Super Actua Flex display (inner screen).

Rear cameras:
The Pixel 9 has a 50MP wide camera and a 48MP ultrawide snapper. The
and XL variant has a 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP telephoto sensor.
The Pixel 9 Pro Fold has a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide snapper and a 10.8MP telephoto sensor.

Front cameras:
The Pixel 9 has a 10.5MP selfie clicker. The Pixel 9 Pro and XL models have a 42MP front camera and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold will have a 10MP selfie shooter.

Processor:
All four Pixel 9 series phones will be powered by Tensor G4 chipset.

RAM:
The Pixel 9 ships with up to 12GB RAM while the Pixel 9 Pro, Pro XL, and Pro Fold have up to 16GB RAM.

Google Pixel 9 series Gemini AI and other features​
Google says these phones are engineered by it and
designed for AI
.

Google promises
seven years of security updates and Pixel Drops
(software updates with new Pixel-exclusive features).

You will get
Emergency SOS
with the new Pixels that shoot crisis alerts about nearby fires or floods. It also claims to thwart malware and phishing scams.

The new Pixel phones will have
Pixel Screenshots
which helps “you save info that you want to remember later – like events, places and more”. You can open Pixel Screenshots later to find what you are forgetting or missing. In a way, it is like a watered-down Microsoft Recall feature.

The promo material also shows the various ways Gemini AI and Circle to Search can be helpful.

Last but not least, the Pixel 9 Pro XL (and probably other models) will come with a 1-meter
USB-C to USB-C cable
(USB 2.0) in the box.

limmk,2024-07-31T16:11:48+0800,"I'm buying a Pixel 9 Pro but plan to wait — here’s why​
Waiting a few months longer could lead to some big savings
After
, I have come to the conclusion that it’s time to ditch my aging
. After almost 3 years with the former flagship, I am a firm convert to team Pixel. Not only because I get all the latest Android updates right away, but also thanks to the exclusive features no other Android phone has to offer.
Naturally I’ll be swapping out my Pixel 6 Pro for a
of some kind. Maybe not the
, which is probably going to be far too expensive for my salary, but certainly the 9 Pro or the
. However, choosing between the models isn’t my biggest concern right now. I’m actually pondering whether it’s actually worth buying the Pixel 9 Pro at launch — or if I should wait a few more months
Waiting could be easier on my finances​



One of the things I’ve noticed over the past several years is that Google phones go on sale with alarming regularity. More importantly they also start getting discounted very early on in their life cycle. One good example of this was during last year’s Black Friday sales, when the
— a savings of 20%.
We became aware of that discount on November 16, while the
series went on sale on October 12. So in the space of five weeks, the price of a major flagship dropped by a fifth. It’s not the first time this has happened to Pixel phones either; I remember the sinking feeling in my stomach, watching the price of a Pixel 6 Pro drop for Black Friday when I had pre-ordered my handset at full price just a few weeks prior.
Pixel phones are slightly more expensive than they were in 2021, thanks to last year's price hike. And while we still don't know what the Pixel 9 series will bring, the opportunity to save as much money as possible is always a smart decision.
Were the Pixel 9 series being released in October, as usual, I wouldn’t have any qualms about waiting another month and a half to buy one. It’s not a huge amount of time to wait, and while I’ll miss out on any pre-order gifts the prospect of saving even $100 off the price tag is very appealing. But this year’s a little different, because the Pixel 9 series is launching two months early — at a
.
Patience doesn’t just revolve around money​



That wait may not be as bad as it seems at first glance. For starters, one of my main reasons for getting rid of the Pixel 6 Pro is that it’s scheduled to get its final Android update sometime in October.
The fact the Pixel 9 is arriving early isn’t going to change that timetable and it should still get the launch version of
. Plus up until a month ago I was perfectly fine with waiting for a presumed October Google event — and I don’t really see why that should change because Google’s changing things up.
It’s also worth remembering that buying products at launch has inherent disadvantages. Pre-ordering means you’ve committed to buying a device that nobody has used yet, and waiting means the phone can be thoroughly tested and evaluated — working out its battery life, hardware performance and the quality of the camera. Battery life is particularly important for me, because that’s one of the things
.
On top of that a lot of phones have issues out of the box, some of which don’t get fixed for weeks or months after they’re first spotted. This has been particularly problematic for Pixel phones over the past few years, and every year we see a bunch of people report various problems that may or may not get fixed.
So not only could you potentially save money by waiting until the Black Friday sales season, it also gives you a chance to do your homework — and make sure you know exactly what to expect when you buy the new phone. Sure you miss the pre-order bonuses, but there’s nothing stopping you from
.
I won’t lie, though, the prospect of saving money is definitely the more enticing reason to wait. The rest of this is just an added bonus.
Whatever happens, it’s still the right time to upgrade​



No matter what happens with the Pixel 9 Pro this year, I know I’m not going to be waiting another year to upgrade. I’ve spent three years with the Pixel 6 Pro, with no regrets, but now’s the time to move on — for a variety of reasons.
The big one is that the phone is losing Android update support this year, since it arrived
. While it is still set for security updates until October 2026, the lack of features is something I’d rather avoid, particularly since my job revolves around knowing about all the latest phones and features.
In recent months I’ve also found my phone is starting to get pretty dated. The battery is not what it used to be, and believe me the Pixel 6 Pro never had a particularly good battery life to begin with. I’ve seen more single digit battery percentages in the last three months than I have in the last three years, and it’s getting to be rather annoying. I’ve also come to the realization that the camera is quickly falling behind some of Google’s rivals.
It’s still a good camera, but when a flagship is being
you know that camera tech has been advancing rather rapidly over the past couple of years. I’d quite like to be able to take advantage of those advances myself, while also being able to use the one thing the Pixel 8a lacks — a telephoto zooming lens.


Finally, my 6 Pro’s case is clinging onto the last few breaths of life. It’s quite a small thing to be annoyed about, especially since buying a new case is significantly easier and cheaper than a new phone. But this case is also coming up to its third birthday and it’s literally being held together by duct tape in places. If that’s not a sign the phone may be getting past its best, I don’t know what is. (Yes, I could get one of the
, I know).
Bottom line​
I had always planned to upgrade to the Pixel 9 Pro later this year, but Google has thrown a wrench into my initial plan by bringing the launch event up by two whole months. So now I have to make that decision of whether it’s more prudent to upgrade right away, and take advantage of whatever early adopter deals are on offer from carriers, or if I should wait a little longer and see what the Black Friday sales season brings.
Right now I’m leaning towards the latter. It was exactly what I had intended to do in the first place, and my Pixel 6 Pro isn’t so decrepit that I can’t keep hold of it for another couple of months. I’m not hedging my bets on Black Friday sales being as lucrative as they have been in the past, especially after the Pixel 8a only got a $50 discount during
. But there’s a chance I may be able to save a couple hundred dollars on a new flagship — and right now that feels like a risk I’m willing to take.
Maybe I’ll change my mind between now and August 13, based on a new rumor of what Google actually unveils at the Made by Google event. Or maybe I’ll go back and forth more times than a hallway chase in Scooby Doo. We’ll just have to wait and see.

Google’s upcoming 45W charger was spotted in regulatory listings before but has been spotted again in marketing materials.

The charger features a rather unconventional port placement, which is likely to burden USB cables with unnatural bends and thus accelerate their wear and tear.

This charger is expected to support 35W fast charging on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but it is unlikely to be bundled in the box as a default.

These freebies are available to those who purchase the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL and Pixel 9 Pro Fold before October 31, 2025. And before December 31, 2025 for the

Google wants its customers to take full advantage of Gemini on Pixel 9​
As expected, Google wants every Pixel 9 customer to be able to take full advantage of Gemini on its new devices. This is why it is offering a year of the Google One AI Premium plan for free with every purchase. This includes Gemini Advanced, as well as 2TB of Google One storage, which can be used for storage of Gmail, photos, videos, documents, and much more. This is a $19.99 per month value, making it a pretty slick freebie for the new Pixel 9 models.
Speaking of Gemini, it’s going to be powering a good number of features on the Pixel 9 series, including Pixel Screenshots. This is essentially a way to better organize your screenshots, and talk to Gemini in a conversational way to find different things. Like a WiFi password for your AirBnB or someone’s phone number that you took a screenshot of.

This time around, Evan Blass shared three separate images of the Pixel 9, one of which shows the phone in all colors. He shared two Pixel 9 Pro images, one of which shows the phone in all of its upcoming color variants. On top of that, he added a handful of Pixel 9 Pro XL images, and one Pixel 9 Pro Fold render.
All four Pixel 9 devices are shown in colorful renders below​
If you take a look at the gallery below, you’ll see the Pixel 9. The phone is coming in Rose, Porcelain, Green, and Obsidian color options. That’s the order of colors you’ll see in the first image below, by the way.
The
Pixel 9 Pro, on the other hand, is depicted in two images below. As you can see, that device is also coming in four colors, and they are Obsidian, Porcelain, Rose, and Hazel. That’s the order shown below.
The company’s second-gen foldable will look considerably different than the first-gen one​
The Pixel 9 Pro XL will look the same as the Pixel 9 Pro, but it will be larger, and you can see it below. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold is also shown in an image in the gallery below. It’s shown in its Obsidian model, and it will look considerably different compared to the Pixel Fold. A completely new aspect ratio and camera design too.

The tipster also shared some Pixel 9 cases for us to check out​
In regards to cases, Evan Blass shared four of them, but without any explanation. The first one seems to be one of Google’s regular cases for the Pixel. a plastic one. The one following it is a clear gel case, while the last two are rather interesting. The third case in the gallery has a ring on the back, hinting at MagSafe functionality. The last one seems to be some sort of a folio case. We doubt all of these come from Google, though, that’s almost certainly not the case.

Available Colors and Memory Options​
The Pixel 9 Pro XL comes in two storage configurations: 256GB and 512GB, both paired with 16GB of RAM. The 256GB variant is available in four stunning colors: Hazel, Obsidian, Porcelain, and Rose Quartz. For those opting for the 512GB model, Obsidian is the exclusive color option, adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to your device
Design and Build Quality​
Google has continued its tradition of crafting beautifully designed smartphones, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL is no exception. With a glass front and back protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and an aluminum frame, this device is both sleek and durable. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is also slimmer than its predecessor, the Pixel 8 series, making it more comfortable to hold and use. It is IP68 dust and water-resistant, ensuring that your device can withstand the elements.
Display and Performance​
The Pixel 9 Pro XL features a stunning 6.8-inch LTPO OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support, providing crystal-clear visuals and smooth scrolling. The display boasts a peak brightness of 3000 nits, making it easy to see in any lighting conditions. With a resolution of 1344 x 2992 pixels and a 20:9 aspect ratio, you’ll experience sharp and vibrant images whether you’re watching videos, browsing the web, or playing games.
Powered by the latest Google Tensor G4 chipset, built on a 4 nm process, and running Android 15, the Pixel 9 Pro XL delivers fast and efficient performance. Combined with 16GB of RAM and UFS 4.0 storage, this smartphone can handle even the most demanding tasks with ease.
Revolutionary Gemini AI​
One of the standout features of the Pixel 9 Pro XL is the integration of Google’s Gemini AI. This advanced AI system is designed to enhance your user experience by learning your preferences and optimizing performance accordingly. Whether it’s battery management, camera settings, or app usage, Gemini AI ensures that your device is always running at its best.
Advanced Camera System​
Photography enthusiasts will be thrilled with the Pixel 9 Pro XL’s triple camera setup. The main camera includes a 50 MP wide lens with multi-zone Laser AF and OIS, a 48 MP periscope telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, and a 48 MP ultrawide lens with a 123˚ field of view. With features like Dual-LED flash, Pixel Shift, Ultra-HDR, and Best Take, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is equipped to capture stunning photos and videos in any situation. The 42 MP front-facing camera also supports 4K video recording, ensuring that your selfies and video calls are of the highest quality.
Connectivity and Battery Life​
The Pixel 9 Pro XL supports a wide range of network technologies, including GSM, HSPA, LTE, and 5G, ensuring that you have fast and reliable connectivity no matter where you are. The device also features advanced communication options such as Wi-Fi 6e/7, Bluetooth 5.4, and Ultra Wideband (UWB) support.
Battery life is another area where the Pixel 9 Pro XL excels. It comes equipped with a 5060 mAh non-removable battery that supports 45W wired charging, 23W wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging.

About the topic of Google blacklisting Mrwhosetheboss for criticising the Google Pixel 8 Pro...
Basically,
Mrwhosetheboss opinions are valid.
Mrwhosetheboss' choice of words in his Pixel 8 video title is misleading.
Google is also wrong for blacklisting people just because they criticise its products.
Communication is the entire point of this topic.
------------
Here's my opinion
After watching the video once again, Arun's *opinions* on his Google Pixel 8/8 Pro review ARE PERFECTLY FAIR.
While I do think that the Google Pixel 8 are still more worthy to buy than the iPhone 15/15 Plus (not just because of high refresh rate), the iPhone 15 did have some great changes compared to its predecessors.
That was the best time to upgrade, and that's why most reviewers agree that iPhone 15 was a nice upgrade compared to iPhone 14.
I think the real reason why some people think Arun is being unfair to Google is the choice of words chosen in his Pixel 8 review.
For example, his title for the iPhone 15/15 Plus review was ""Suspiciously Good!"" while his title for the Google Pixel 8/8 Pro review was a simple ""Problems!""
Aside from the fact that the title was very uninspiring and too clickbaity, it didn't represent all the things that Google did with those phones, as there were some very nice upgrades to those phones.
It's not like the Pixel 8 was filled with issues to the point that they're worthy to be considered as problematic.
I don't like to compare one reviewer with another, but if we look at MKBHD's title, it represents the main thing that Google did back then, which was AI in photos.
As a reviewer, I think you should create a catchy title that represents the phone instead of creating a negative clickbaity title that misleads people into disliking the phone.
With that being said, I really hate it when a company blocks reviewers from receiving/trying its new phones and accessing information about those products after those reviewers fairly criticise their past products.
Blacklisting people for criticising your company or its products is a very stupid thing to do, especially if you're blacklisting creators as big as Mrwhosetheboss.
Also, criticisms help the company and its products grow. The next step is to fix those problems and let the reviewers check out the new stuff that they made/fixed.

Over the years, Google has steadily increased the prices of its Pixel products. Once considered affordable flagships — the Pixel 6 and
launched at just $599 — prices went up with the
series. The
now hovers around $500, while the standard Pixel 9 starts at $699. The Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999, and the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL starts at $1,099 — a significant jump compared to prices just two years ago.
If you’re considering upgrading to the new Pixel 9 series and don't want to overspend, the Pixel 9 Pro might be a better choice. Even though it comes with a starting price tag of $999, which is still a significant investment, it offers the same features as the larger model, with some minor differences. I'd suggest using the savings to invest in the best cases or accessories for your Pixel 9 Pro, which would add to the cost anyway.
2You get a compact, easier-to-handle form factor​
The Google Pixel 9 Pro is easier to hold, easier to carry, and fits in your pocket​



Not everyone has large hands, and for those like me, handling large smartphones like the
and
can be quite a challenge. However, to get the best features, such as the telephoto lens, you had to opt for the larger model. Fortunately, Google has finally addressed this with the Pixel 9 series, offering a smaller screen Pro model.
This means that those who prefer a compact Pro smartphone with all the best features finally have the option with the Pixel 9 Pro. It's nearly 12% smaller than the Pixel 9 Pro XL in overall dimensions, making it more pocketable and easier to carry. Despite its smaller size, the Pixel 9 Pro still has a 6.3-inch display, offering plenty of space for streaming videos and playing games. If you prefer compact and easy-to-handle phones, the Pixel 9 Pro is for you.

Finally, a real deal small Android flagship
3You get a (minor) display update​
The Pixel 9 Pro's display has a slightly higher pixel density​



While we're talking about displays, the Pixel 9 Pro actually has the best specs among all the Pixel 9 models, even if the difference is minor. Although the Pixel 9 Pro features a smaller 6.3-inch display compared to the 6.8-inch screen on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, it still offers the same 120Hz refresh rate, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, up to 3000 nits of peak brightness, and a full 24-bit depth for 16 million colors.
But when it comes to pixel density, the Pixel 9 Pro has a slight advantage. With a resolution of 1280 x 2856, it has a higher pixel density of 495 PPI compared to the XL's 486 PPI. While this difference might go unnoticed by the naked eye, if you have a keen eye for
pixels
, the Pixel 9 Pro should be your top choice.
4The camera and nearly all features are the same​
Save $100 with the Pixel 9 Pro without sacrificing many features​




















In the past, you had to buy the larger Pixel model to get the best camera, as the telephoto sensor was exclusive to the big-screen Pro models. But with the Pixel 9 Pro, you now get the same camera hardware as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Both models feature the same 50MP primary camera, 48MP ultra-wide sensor, and 48MP telephoto sensor with up to 10x optical zoom. The selfie camera is also identical, with a 42MP sensor on both models.
In fact, most other features, such as build quality, IP68 dust and water resistance, seven years of software updates, 16GB RAM, the Tensor G4 processor, new Gemini AI features, and Satellite SOS, remain the same across both models. The main difference lies in the battery capacity: the XL model has a 5,060 mAh battery, while the Pixel 9 Pro has a 4,700 mAh cell — which is understandable, given the size difference. But that's about it.
Pixel 9 Pro delivers better value for your money​
Whether you’re upgrading to a new smartphone or considering buying one, the Pixel 9 Pro seems like the smarter choice; while the Pixel 9 Pro XL offers a larger screen, it's also $100 more than what the Pixel 8 Pro used to cost.
However, if you still prefer the Pixel 9 Pro XL, it's also a great option, especially since it's available for preorder now and will be in stores ahead of the Pixel 9 Pro on August 22, 2024.",1the google pixel 9 pro cheaper supersized sibling pixel 9 pro starts 99 us xl starts 109 lightbox_close close lightbox_next next lightbox_previous previous lightbox_eror requested content not loaded please try later lightbox_start_slideshow start slideshow lightbox_stop_slideshow stop slideshow lightbox_ful_scren full screen lightbox_thumbnails thumbnails lightbox_download download lightbox_share share lightbox_zom zoom lightbox_new_window new window lightbox_togle_sidebar toggle sidebar years google steadily increased prices pixel products considered affordable flagships pixel 6 launched 59 prices went series hovers around 500 standard pixel 9 starts 69 pixel 9 pro starts 99 larger pixel 9 pro xl starts 109 significant jump compared prices two years ago youre considering upgrading new pixel 9 series not want overspend pixel 9 pro might better choice even though comes starting price tag 99 still significant investment offers features larger model minor differences would suggest using savings invest best cases accessories pixel 9 pro would add cost anyway 2you get compact easiertohandle form factor google pixel 9 pro easier hold easier carry fits pocket not everyone large hands like handling large smartphones like quite challenge however get best features telephoto lens opt larger model fortunately google finally addressed pixel 9 series offering smaller screen pro model means prefer compact pro smartphone best features finally option pixel 9 pro nearly 12 smaller pixel 9 pro xl overall dimensions making pocketable easier carry despite smaller size pixel 9 pro still 63inch display offering plenty space streaming videos playing games prefer compact easytohandle phones pixel 9 pro related finally real deal small android flagship 3you get minor display update pixel 9 pros display slightly higher pixel density talking displays pixel 9 pro actually best specs among pixel 9 models even difference minor although pixel 9 pro features smaller 63inch display compared 68inch screen pixel 9 pro xl still offers 120hz refresh rate gorilla glass victus 2 300 nits peak brightness full 24bit depth 16 million colors comes pixel density pixel 9 pro slight advantage resolution 1280 x 2856 higher pixel density 495 pi compared xls 486 pi difference might go unnoticed naked eye keen eye pixels pixel 9 pro top choice 4the camera nearly features save 100 pixel 9 pro without sacrificing many features past buy larger pixel model get best camera telephoto sensor exclusive bigscren pro models pixel 9 pro get camera hardware pixel 9 pro xl models feature 50mp primary camera 48mp ultrawide sensor 48mp telephoto sensor 10x optical zoom selfie camera also identical 42mp sensor models fact features build quality ip68 dust water resistance seven years software updates 16gb ram tensor g4 processor new gemini ai features satellite sos remain across models main difference lies battery capacity xl model 5060 mah battery pixel 9 pro 470 mah cell understandable given size difference pixel 9 pro delivers better value money whether youre upgrading new smartphone considering buying one pixel 9 pro seems like smarter choice pixel 9 pro xl offers larger screen also 100 pixel 8 pro used cost however still prefer pixel 9 pro xl also great option especially since available preorder stores ahead pixel 9 pro august 22 2024

The Pixel 9 series launched with Android 14 instead of Android 15.

With a maximum of 7 major OS updates, the Pixel 9 series will not receive the Android 22 update in the future.

It begs the question if Google did this deliberately or if there were other factors involved.

15PM: Better video call quality, thermals.

Power efficiency is kinda a tie as P9PXL runs at higher brightness and fps hence more battery consumed.

If you ended up buying one, I’m here to tell you that you can immediately take that Pixel 9 series phone out of the box, walk through setup, and then join the Android 15 Beta program.
In a brief note on the Android 15 release notes page, Google says that as of August 22, all of the new Pixel 9 models have been added to the beta. They’ve posted both factory image and OTA files, for those looking to get started.
As of this moment, I’m not seeing my Pixel 9 review units listed as eligible in the Android Beta Program page. However, that could change before the day ends. I’ll update this post if that does indeed change.
For now, Pixel 9 owners can sideload OTA or factory image files to get on Android 15 Beta 4.2. It is the same AP31.240617.015 build that was released on August 13 for the rest of the still-supported Pixel line-up.
On a related note, there’s a chance that we get an even newer Android 15 build at any moment. Google told us that Android 15 QPR1 is on the way.
UPDATE
:
It’s available now!

limmk,2024-08-25T02:21:30+0800,"TL;DR
The Google Pixel 9 has a new Adaptive Touch feature that’s enabled by default.

Adaptive Touch automatically adjusts your Pixel 9’s touch sensitivity based on various factors.

For example, it boosts the sensitivity when your fingers are wet or when you apply a screen protector.

The
series just debuted less than two weeks ago, and we’re still finding new aspects about the phones that Google didn’t tell us about. That isn’t too surprising, considering the Made by Google keynote lasted about an hour and twenty minutes, with twenty of those minutes being spent on Google’s AI services rather than the new hardware. Even so, we thought we already knew everything there was to know about the Pixel 9’s display, but as it turns out, it still had one more trick up its sleeves: Adaptive Touch.
Tucked under
Settings > Display > Touch sensitivity
is a new
Adaptive Touch
feature. When Adaptive Touch is enabled, “touch sensitivity will automatically adjust to your environment, activities and screen protector.”





If this feature sounds familiar, it’s because we reported back in March that the
. At the time, though, we didn’t know what environmental factors or activities would cause the Pixel 9’s touch sensitivity to be automatically adjusted. Now that we have the device in our hands, though, we can confirm that wet fingers (or rather, a wet screen) are one factor that impacts touch sensitivity.
We compared the touch sensitivity of the Pixel 9 with Adaptive Touch to a Pixel 8 Pro without Adaptive Touch, and the results were clear: the Pixel 9 works much better with wet fingers than the Pixel 8 Pro. As you can see in the video embedded in this article, scrolling with a wet finger looks pretty normal on the Pixel 9. In contrast, there are random jumps and pans on the Pixel 8 Pro when scrolling with a wet finger.
Although I don’t have a screen protector yet for my Pixel 9, I’m guessing that Adaptive Touch will simply boost the touch sensitivity whenever it detects that a screen protector has been applied to the device. If so, then this aspect of Adaptive Touch isn’t actually new functionality, as this also happens with the Pixel 8 as well. The difference now is that the Pixel 9 can automatically adjust its touch sensitivity in more scenarios beyond just screen protectors.
The Adaptive Touch feature was enabled by default on our Pixel 9 review unit as well as on a Pixel 9 Pro XL retail unit running the stock firmware. Thus, you don’t need to dive into the Settings app to enable it. I’m not sure why you’d ever want to disable Adaptive Touch, but if you do, the toggle can be found under
Settings > Display > Touch sensitivity
, as mentioned previously.
If you’ve picked up a Pixel 9 already, let us know how its touch sensitivity compares to your previous phone! And if you have issues with touch sensitivity on the new phone, you can try the new
Touch diagnostics
troubleshooting menu under
Settings > Display
.

Wireless charging is a wonderful feature, but it’s not quite as reliable as a standard plug-in cable. It’s not uncommon for a charger to not work perfectly with certain smartphones, but one would think that Google’s own wireless charger would work pretty well for charging the company’s own new Pixel 9 series smartphones.
Unfortunately, though, there are some hiccups going on.
Some early Pixel 9 series buyers, the Pixel 9 Pro XL in particular, have found that wireless charging is a bit inconsistent. Reports on

and
see Pixel 9 Pro XL buyers running into charging that starts just fine, but fails after a few seconds or a few minutes. Some report the issue on MagSafe style chargers with a case, as well as the phone without a case on Google’s own Pixel Stand charger.
We’ve experienced this issue twice since
, in both cases on the Pixel Stand which was showing a quickly blinking orange and white light to indicate the error.
Google has yet to publicly acknowledge the issue, but
noticed
where a user claims that Google Support told them that “it is a known bug that they are looking into with engineering.” As with any information provided by support, though, this should be taken with a grain of salt.
Interestingly, those affected by this issue say that there’s no overheating going on. That suggests that it might not be a hardware or alignment issue, but rather something in software. However, it’s a little too early to tell for sure. The smaller Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro do not appear to be affected, at least to the same extent.

An owner of the Pixel 9 Pro XL claims their phone has a camera tilt issue.

The issue seems to appear when switching to the 5x telephoto lens.

It appears a handful of other buyers are experiencing something similar.

Now that the
has launched, Google’s new flagship is starting to get into the hands of consumers. Unfortunately, some buyers had a bit of bad luck with their purchase as reports are popping up about a camera tilt defect.
Google launched the Pixel 9 family on August 13, with the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL hitting store shelves on August 22. One Pixel 9 Pro XL owner has now taken to
to talk about a camera problem they’re experiencing with their telephoto lens.
According to the Reddit user, they noticed a “disturbing tilt” while recording a video. The user claims that they discovered the problem when attempting to switch from 2x zoom to 5x zoom. That user recorded a video of the defect, which you can see below.

It’s unclear how widespread this issue is, but this owner was not alone. Within the same thread, a few other owners chimed in, claiming they have tilt issues as well. However, it appears the problem is not isolated to the telephoto lens.
One Reddit user alleges that the tilt can be seen with their ultrawide lens, while another said they saw it on both the telephoto and ultrawide lenses. Meanwhile, one person says the problem happens to them too, but not every time.

Update: Given 2 Options
Advanced Exchange: With Advanced Exchange we'll provide you with a link to order your replacement device and it will ship to you before you need to send your defective device back. This way, you're not without a device and you can easily transfer your data from the old device to the replacement device.
You would need to place an order for the replacement device within 30 days from the time your replacement request is initiated to ensure it is not canceled.
Please note, this option will require an authorization hold on a credit or debit card for the full cost of the device, but once your defective device is returned, the authorization hold is removed from your card.
Exchange: With Exchange you'll send your device back to Google, and once your device is received and inspected, your replacement device will be shipped to you. With Exchange, there is no need for an authorization hold, but it may take anywhere from 5-10 business days from start to finish.
You would need to ship the defective device 14 days from the time your replacement request is initiated to ensure it is not canceled.
Replacement devices may be new or refurbished based on location and inventory. Every refurbished device undergoes a comprehensive inspection and refurbishment process. We test extensively and replace the battery, cover glass, and back case with OEM parts so the device will look and operate like new.",update given 2 options advanced exchange advanced exchange provide link order replacement device ship need send defective device back way not without device easily transfer data old device replacement device would need place order replacement device within 30 days time replacement request initiated ensure not canceled please note option require authorization hold credit debit card full cost device defective device returned authorization hold removed card exchange exchange send device back google device received inspected replacement device shipped exchange no need authorization hold may take anywhere 510 business days start finish would need ship defective device 14 days time replacement request initiated ensure not canceled replacement devices may new refurbished based location inventory every refurbished device undergoes comprehensive inspection refurbishment process test extensively replace battery cover glass back case oem parts device look operate like new

limmk,2024-08-28T18:42:20+0800,"Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL outperform the competition in terms of thermal management, but have significantly shorter battery life​
As a test on the YouTube channel TechDroider showed, the temperature management of the new Google flagships works very well. In terms of battery life, however, they cannot keep up with the competition from Samsung and Apple.
In a test by the YouTube channel
, the new Google flagships Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL were put through their paces. Although Google has improved the battery capacity of both models, the test results were disappointing compared to other top models. While the Pixel 9 (4,700 mAh) and Pixel 9 Pro XL (5,060 mAh) achieved a runtime of around 10 hours and 25 minutes, the iPhone 15 Pro Max was clearly ahead with 11 hours and 44 minutes. The Galaxy S24 Ultra also outperformed the Pixel models with 10 hours and 47 minutes.
However, the thermal efficiency of the new Pixel smartphones is remarkable. A maximum value of just 40.9°C was measured for both devices, setting new standards in this area. By comparison, temperatures of 44.6°C were measured for the iPhone 15 Pro Max. The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra even reached 50.4°C. The low temperatures could be due to the optimized heat dissipation of the new Tensor G4 chip. What is striking here, however, is that the base Pixel 9 does not have a vapor chamber, which normally contributes to better cooling, but still reaches the same maximum values as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.
In earlier tests, the Pixel 9 Pro XL was highly praised for its exceptional camera quality. It even
among top camera smartphones in the DxOMark rankings. However, when it comes to gaming performance, the Google smartphone falls short of matching the capabilities of flagship models from other manufacturers. As early benchmarks had hinted, the Tensor G4's performance in
, particularly with
, was disappointing. It lagged 15% behind the two-year-old Tensor G2, highlighting a significant regression in gaming capabilities despite being a newer processor.

Teardowns of the Pixel 9 Pro XL faulted Google for hiding screws
. This guide should help identify everything, while the document shows the different type of screws in use:


The guides provide step-by-step instructions to open and close a Pixel device, though they veer towards having some prior repair knowledge. Google provides disassembly and assembly flowcharts that keep in mind the dual-entry design.
Also of note is how the Pixel 9, 9 Pro, and 9 Pro Fold “don’t require UDFPS calibration.”

Google’s Pixel 9 Pro XL: Designing for Durability
Google’s Pixel 9 phones are marketed as durable and sustainable, with a promise of 7 years of software updates. However, despite improvements, these phones can still break. The question is, how repairable are they?
The Teardown
Starting the teardown, I expected a similar construction to past Pixels. The screen opening process seemed smoother, but on closer inspection, I found signs of delamination, which resulted in a broken screen. This type of damage highlights the problem with screen entry designs, which are not ideal for battery replacement.
The back cover removal was less stressful. The exterior shell of the camera bump is incorporated into the cover, making it easier to replace the battery without removing the screen. However, the execution of the dual entry design needs improvement.
Battery Removal
The battery removal process is challenging due to the sliding saw style pull tab mechanism. Despite online guides, it’s not easy to use. After soaking the battery in isopropyl alcohol, I managed to remove it, but not without damaging the heatsink for the screen.
Internal Components
The lower speaker and daughterboard, which now houses the USB-C port, are more approachable. The haptic motor comes away easily, and after removing all visible screws, the mainboard and rear camera assembly are freed.
Camera Assembly
The camera assembly is held in place by three press connectors accessible from the rear side of the mainboard. From left to right, the cameras have a 50-megapixel Samsung ISOCELL GNK sensor, a 48-megapixel Sony IMX858 sensor on the ultrawide, and another 48-megapixel Sony IMX858 sensor on the 5X optical zoom camera.
Increased Durability
Google claims the Pixel 9 increases durability by twofold during drop tests. The internal structure has changed, and CT scans by Lumafield show that the dual entry design provides additional structural rigidity.
Pros and Cons
The Pixel 9 Pro XL has some interesting surprises, but also some drawbacks. The battery removal experience is poor, and the screens are fragile. However, Google’s claims of doubling durability seem true, and the dual entry design increases durability and improves overall repairability.
Repairability Score
Considering these factors, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL receives a provisional repairability score of 5 out of 10. There’s room for improvement, but Google is showing a genuine desire to design for sustainability.",ifixit ai summary not copy youtube transcript not know 3 posted not googles pixel 9 pro xl designing durability googles pixel 9 phones marketed durable sustainable promise 7 years software updates however despite improvements phones still break question repairable teardown starting teardown expected similar construction past pixels screen opening process seemed smoother closer inspection found signs delamination resulted broken screen type damage highlights problem screen entry designs not ideal battery replacement back cover removal less stressful exterior shell camera bump incorporated cover making easier replace battery without removing screen however execution dual entry design needs improvement battery removal battery removal process challenging due sliding saw style pull tab mechanism despite online guides not easy use soaking battery isopropyl alcohol managed remove not without damaging heatsink screen internal components lower speaker daughterboard houses usbc port approachable haptic motor comes away easily removing visible screws mainboard rear camera assembly freed camera assembly camera assembly held place three press connectors accessible rear side mainboard left right cameras 50megapixel samsung isocel gnk sensor 48megapixel sony imx858 sensor ultrawide another 48megapixel sony imx858 sensor 5x optical zoom camera increased durability google claims pixel 9 increases durability twofold drop tests internal structure changed ct scans lumafield show dual entry design provides additional structural rigidity pros cons pixel 9 pro xl interesting surprises also drawbacks battery removal experience poor screens fragile however googles claims doubling durability seem true dual entry design increases durability improves overall repairability repairability score considering factors google pixel 9 pro xl receives provisional repairability score 5 10 theres room improvement google showing genuine desire design sustainability

MrCoconut,2024-09-04T10:20:44+0800,"I used to use a P8. my first ever pixel phone. The camera would freeze and hang, which was shocking. When I wanted to take photos of my kids, the camera hangs and the moment was gone. It's my first time ever happening with a phone. before this i was using budget phones for 4 years. but I never encountered such an issue. sometimes the home screen will hang too and i had to wait or even restart my phone. In reddit apparently people have the same issue.
Secondly don't you guys find it uncanny for google to ""launch"" phones when we cannot exactly buy them yet? Worse, the P9P is not even ready for presale. Seems like a hasten job for some reason.
Finally no purchase promo (yet) for P9P? I've been an Android user for 10 years and switched to pixel to support all things google but my experience yet have been quite disappointing
once when i opened my camera app, this is what i saw. never seen this before in any of the budget phones i used. when i asked at google authorised service centre, they told me have to factory reset my phone. but i could not afford to do that as i have set up the phone fully. ironically, it's because of the pixel 8 that's why i am using an iphone 12 pro now. even for a 4 year old phone, the performance is just amazing. amazing speed with no lags and hangs

It figures, since it can't even be used to charge Google's own flagship handset.
TL;DR
- The Pixel Stand 2 is apparently no longer available to buy online from the Google Store.
- The development follows the discovery that the wireless charging accessory isn’t compatible with the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold.
Google was a little late to the game with
, but finally stepped up back in 2018 with the Pixel Stand. A second-gen model followed in 2021, and while all was good for a while, after the extraordinary revelation that the new
, it was likely that Google would move to address the situation in some way. As such, it may be no coincidence that the wireless charger is now no longer available to buy online from the Google Store.
We were alerted to this new development by a Reddit post from user
. The Redditor explains that they were hoping to get a discount on the Pixel Stand (2nd gen) but were unable to find it. After a little digging, they realized it was no longer listed for sale on either the US or Canadian
online.
Google recently updated its support documentation, acknowledging that its high-end $1,800 foldable phone doesn’t support either the Pixel Stand or Pixel Stand 2. The problem stems from the placement of the wireless charging coil on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which isn’t perfectly centered like on previous Pixel phones. Still, you’d expect Google to have anticipated this problem.
It is possible that Google’s halt on Pixel Stand 2 sales is temporary or unrelated to the Fold fiasco. In any event, those who own or plan to buy the Pixel 9 Pro Fold are left to explore third-party wireless charging options for now.

But in short, charge to full then drain it until the phone turns off by itself. Then charge it to 100% with additional 2 hours or more. (Your phone will turn on after plugging the cable, turn it off then it won't turn on afterwards).
Sometimes the OS will have different reading as the actual battery percentage and when it reaches 100% on the OS, it will cut the charging of the battery. So your battery won't be fully charge, then will have sudden leap in battery percentage because of inconsistency. At some point, it is normal to be like this so just need to calibrate.

1. Camera would freeze randomly
2. Phone could hang suddenly for a few seconds
3. Some apps cannot be used. It could be a problem with Android 14
4. Google pay does not support as many banks as apple pay
5. Using a iphone 12 pro now. The OS is really not intuitive. But for a 4yo phone, it works like a blaze. I'm very surprised
6. It's battery health is 70% now but a change of battery could make it as good as new

8. Gboard seems to work better in pixel when I swipe type

Apple Intelligence is supposed to be the tentpole feature* for iPhone 16, and lo and behold, it’s only going to be launched in “2025”. As the original poster opined, there’s no good reason to buy the iPhone 16 now, with its tentpole feature missing currently, and which is only coming out in the future, within an extremely long stated period of an entire year. For all we know, iPhone 17 may already be out and Apple Intelligence (if you’re into AI gimmicks) may still not be released in Singapore.

limmk,2024-11-10T13:49:11+0800,"I tested the Pixel 9's excellent new underwater camera mode in the blue Hawaii waters​
Pixel phones have a new underwater camera mode, and I put it to the test in Hawaii.
In the latest
(formerly known as Pixel Feature Drops) from October, Google launched a new underwater camera mode for the most recent phones in
. This feature uses software optimizations to enhance photos and videos captured underwater to make them look as good as possible.
To be clear, Pixels supported underwater enhancements as far back as the Pixel 7 series.
about how Googler José Ricardo Lima used a
to capture some underwater shots in Maui, Hawaii, for example. The recent Pixel Drop, though, allows the underwater mode to work on the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold with any underwater case, not just specific cases Google has vetted. This makes the feature much more accessible to people, as you don’t need an expensive diver-quality case to see those optimizations (the one Lima used for that blog post costs many hundreds of dollars).
The big question, though, is how good this new feature is. I was in Maui recently for the launch of the
chipset. I had my Pixel 9 Pro with me, so I decided to slap it into an inexpensive underwater phone case (
) and see what this new camera mode was all about.
Turning on and using the underwater camera mode​



Before you jump into the ocean to test this feature out, know that you need to turn it on. Because this feature no longer requires a specific case to work properly, your Pixel won’t be able to determine if you want to use the underwater mode automatically. This seems like something
could eventually solve by simply looking through your viewfinder and determining, “Yep, this phone is not on dry land,” but that’s not the case today. For now, before you start shooting, you need to open the Camera app on your Pixel, tap the Settings icon in the lower left, and then visit
More Settings > Advanced > Underwater photography and video
, and toggle it on.
It’s important to note that this activates the feature indefinitely. Thankfully, Google gives you a permanent alert in the viewfinder to remind you it’s on, so you don’t forget to turn it off when your underwater adventure is over.


Mode on, under the water


Mode still on, on solid land
Once you activate the feature and are in a body of water, you can do pretty much anything you would typically do with your Pixel camera. That includes regular photos and videos, Night Sight,
, Cinematic Blur, etc. This is nice as it doesn’t limit your creativity once you’re splashing and diving.
Once you activate the feature and are in a body of water, you can do pretty much anything you would typically do with your Pixel camera. That includes regular photos and videos, Night Sight,
, Cinematic Blur, etc. This is nice as it doesn’t limit your creativity once you’re splashing and diving.
Remember that touchscreens don't work underwater, so you'll need to plan ahead to make sure your camera is in the correct mode.
​
The trick, though, is that you can’t use the touchscreen when you are submerged. You’ll need to rely on camera shortcuts using the phone’s physical buttons. For reference, this includes launching the camera app (even if the phone is locked) by double-tapping the power button and then using either of the volume keys to activate the shutter. Unfortunately, without using the touchscreen, there’s no way to change modes, zoom in or out, swap lenses, etc.. This means you need to bring the phone out of the water to make these adjustments and then submerge yourself again to get the desired shot. But if you just want to grab quick snaps, you can do what you need while actually in the water.
To my embarrassment, I didn’t work this all out on the beach — I was actually snorkeling while trying to figure it all out. Heed my words: Get this all sorted
before
you put on your swimsuit. You’ll have a much better time.
Pixel 9 Pro underwater photos​



I tried to get photos with the underwater mode off and on to get a good idea of what it does. Because of the previously discussed touchscreen limitations — and the natural buoyancy of the human body — this was not easy to do. As such, please forgive me for not getting perfectly aligned shots to show side-by-side comparisons.
First, check out these two photos to see if you can spot what the underwater camera mode enhances:

Underwater Mode On


Underwater Mode Off
These images are compressed, but by looking at the originals, I see that clarity is slightly higher with the underwater mode activated. The water also looks more blue overall.

limmk,2024-11-11T01:28:51+0800,"The Pixel 9 series seems to be a massive hit for Google, and it comes at least in part from Google fixing the biggest problems with from its past smartphones.
Through the entire Pixel series, Google has had a lot of ups and downs in the smartphone industry. There have generally been some big downsides, oversights, or deal-breaking flaws in a lot of the company’s smartphones.
Looking back to the first Pixel generation, Google put out a very solid experience, but it was understandably viewed as sitting behind the curve on smartphone design. That was well outweighed by the software experience and the cameras, but there’s no denying that Google was very much on its first generation.
Fast-forward to the Pixel 2 series and the main flaw was that Google had two drastically different devices. The smaller Pixel 2 had a very outdated look for 2017, while the Pixel 2 XL had a display that was maddeningly inconsistent, and often awful. Pixel 3 finally solved a lot of these problems, with better designs and better hardware, though plenty of users couldn’t look past the gigantic “bathtub” display notch.
Google’s Pixel 4 series was among my favorite of the entire series, with a very unique design that really fit Google’s aesthetic of the time. It also pushed into delivering some ideas we’d not really seen on Android, like an IR-based face unlock system and Google’s “Soli” radar. Ultimately, though, the good was outweighed by the truly terrible battery life of the smaller model (the XL was fine) that hardly anyone could ignore. It really put a stain on that generation as a whole.
Through the pandemic, Google had a weird in-between year with the Pixel 5. It was inherently a good smartphone, but the lack of a larger size option was a deal-breaker for plenty of people.




















Then, we entered the Tensor era. Google’s big reboot in the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro was a step in the right direction, but early issues with Tensor, especially in regards to cell reception, really put a stain on the lineup which Google couldn’t escape on Pixel 7. Both devices also left users underwhelmed, or even actively frustrated with the fingerprint sensor being less reliable compared to prior generations.
Pixel 8 was the first time where Google had two, nearly no-compromise smartphones. The overheating issues were largely fixed, Tensor was more powerful and stable than ever, and the displays were exceptionally good, even briefly being (arguably) the best smartphone buyers could get in the States. But, personally, I suspect the damage done by the mixed reputation of Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 left many wary of the Pixel 8.












Finally, I think Google has escaped that reputation, and the sales prove it.
The Pixel 9 series launched in August as Google’s best smartphones to date, full stop. All four devices have grown into mature smartphones that finally nail all of the fundamentals. The displays are great. The cameras, as has been the case since the beginning, are among the best you can get. And Google’s clean and intuitive software is easy to understand and learn. Google has also done a good job marketing these devices to appeal to a specific audience, the people looking to try something that’s not an iPhone. Combined with the arrival of RCS on iOS, a move that takes away one of the biggest hurdles to using an Android phone in the US, it’s really been a perfect storm for Google to finally get some traction in the States.
And it really seems that’s happened.
Google recently
for the Pixel 9 series, but the company really undersold that if recent data is correct.
According to recent reports, Q3 2024 (ending in September) saw
, while also seeing 20% year-over-year growth just in the United States. The Pixel 9 Pro XL in particular seems to stand out,
, a list that also likely includes every iPhone that’s still on sale – 14, 15, and 16 – and all of Samsung’s flagship devices too.
Perhaps the most jaw-dropping data was that
. That tracked traffic is on millions of websites and ca see what device people are using. Apple unsurprisingly makes up over 50% of this traffic in the US, but Google is making up a percentage that’s over half of what Samsung makes up in the States. That’s
huge
if it is true, especially because it’s nearly 3x growth in a single month. It still seems too good to be true, but it’s a big deal if it is.
To me, Google’s work in fixing the biggest Pixel issues – namely cell reception, overheating, and battery life – have finally paid off in Pixel 9. There’s still a vocal group frustrated that Google isn’t using
the best
chips, and others annoyed that the pricing went up this year, but it really seems that the customer has spoken.
What do you think?

Earlier this year, when Google first teased
, a collective groan could be heard around the world. While the phones look great (at least, in my opinion, they do), it is immediately apparent that the Pixel 9 looks a lot like an iPhone. While the
rivalry has died down in recent years, Android fans still don’t appreciate seeing their favorite brands copy from Apple. After all, one of the biggest reasons we flock to Android is because we have the choice
not
to have a phone that looks like everyone else’s. I mean, just look at the image above…it’s an uncanny resemblance!
The easy way to explain Google’s design strategy for the Pixel 9 series is laziness. One could look at the Pixel 9 and say, “Google didn’t want to bother figuring out a unique design for itself, so it just copied the United States’ market leader.” However, I recently talked with Kyle Wiens, the CEO of iFixit, and Shahram Mokhtari, a “Teardown Tech” at iFixit, and we concluded that laziness is probably not why Google leaned on the iPhone for the newest Pixel look. Yes, Google is very likely copying from the iPhone’s design, but “laziness” isn’t the whole story.
To explain our theory properly, let me start by discussing something you might not expect: the European Union.
iPhones, the EU, and repairability​



On June 14, 2024, the EU adopted a new regulation that aims to create
. Regulation like this starts with the European Commission adopting it and then issuing a date on which Member States — all the countries in the EU — must incorporate the rules into their respective lawbooks. For this one related to device repairability, that date is July 31, 2026.
The regulation is very specific about what’s expected, and Wiens — a passionate advocate for repairability — is quite excited about it. “We’re currently trapped in this world where we have two sheets of glass with a consumable glue between them, and we need to find a way to make them last longer,” Wiens explains. This is most notable when discussing smartphone batteries. “What the EU battery directive says is that starting in 2026, manufacturers need to make batteries replaceable by users without crazy tools,” Wiens says. “That is going to require substantial design changes across every smartphone.”
Smartphone makers have until August 2026 to make their designs meet new EU repairability standards.
​
Right now, to replace a battery in a recent flagship smartphone from Apple, Samsung, or Google, you need specialized tools and varying levels of repair skills. Famously, Apple offers
that includes a custom jig just to open up an iPhone. The jig — which only works on one specific iPhone model — applies a certain amount of heat and pressure evenly across the phone to melt the adhesive glue and pull it apart. This jig is rented for $49, and you have seven days from receipt to fix your phone and then ship it back or get charged a penalty. It’s laughably convoluted to the point where very, very few general consumers would ever be able to perform the repair successfully. Even professional repair shops find the process overly complicated.
“[Apple’s jig] is a way of adapting the manufacturing process to repair,” Wiens says. “What the European director is saying is you can’t do that because that’s not realistic. Every repair shop I know has a closet in the back with like, 50 jigs from phones that they’re not even fixing anymore. It’s a crazy amount of waste.”
In order to open up a phone without specialized tools, OEMs will need to fundamentally redesign their devices — and Apple is the furthest along.
​
Apple has made headway in this area, though, likely due to the impending EU regulation. For example, the iPhone designs of the past few years allow you to get to the inside of the phone from either the front or the back. This allows repair technicians to only open the front if they’re doing a display fix and only open the back if they’re doing a battery fix, something that wasn’t possible in earlier designs. Additionally, Apple introduced a new battery with
that is both covered in metal and connected to the phone’s body using a voltage-release adhesive. To remove the battery, you simply apply 12V of electricity to two tabs on it, and it pops right out, saving technicians from needing to apply heat directly to the cell to melt any glue — a dangerous process for obvious reasons. These are just two examples of how Apple has been slowly but steadily working to meet the 2026 guidelines looming on the horizon.
Of course, we have no idea if the iPhone 18 — likely launching in September 2026, after these new regulations take effect — will be fundamentally different in design than what we see today. But we do know that, as it stands right now, Apple is closer to meeting the EU regulations than any other major smartphone OEM, and it’s doing it in a way that still preserves the overall design elegance that people expect from premium smartphones. This, of course, brings us to the Pixel 9.
How the EU likely altered the Pixel design​



The designs of
were not great in terms of repairability. Unlike recent iPhones, to get into a Pixel 8 or Pixel 8 Pro, you needed to go through the front exclusively. The back was a more complex setup with the camera bar cutting it in half and wrapping around to meet the frame in a single metal piece. This meant that
required disassembling the entire phone, a laborious and complicated process that needlessly made accidentally damaging the display a real possibility with every battery repair.
The Pixel 9, though, allows entry from both the front and the back. Now, you can
without taking the whole thing apart. Unfortunately, you still need to remove multiple components to get the battery out, including the camera, the mmWave antenna, the logic board, and more. Additionally, the battery is still glued down, forcing technicians to apply heat to remove it. Mokhtari had this to say: “It is a little bit more difficult to access the battery in the Pixel 9 than the Pixel 8. But broadly speaking, Google does have this architecture for front or back opening that we like.”
Google probably adopted an iPhone-like design for the Pixel 9 because the iPhone is closer to meeting EU regulations than the Pixel 8 was.
​
It doesn’t take an engineer to connect the dots here. The iPhone’s design is the one furthest along when it comes to meeting the future EU regulations. The Pixel 9 looks a lot like an iPhone and is now slightly closer to having the same repairability as one. Could it be that Google is copying the iPhone’s style not out of laziness but out of a crunch for time? It’s evident that if the company has two years to get its devices to be more repairable, it’s easier, cheaper, and faster just to take design ideas from Apple than it would be to start from scratch.
In other words, it is possible — even likely — that the Pixel 9’s design isn’t the result of laziness but the result of crunch. The clock is ticking, and Google doesn’t have the luxury of figuring things out at its own pace.
It might not be laziness pushing the Pixel to look like an iPhone — it might be crunch.
​
Of course, even with cribbing from Apple’s design strategies, Google is still way behind, as made clear by the previously described limitations of fixing a Pixel 9’s battery. The question now becomes whether or not Google will have a solution in place for the expected
before that August 2026 deadline. After all, it can’t wait for Apple to introduce its own designs because it’s likely the Pixel 11 will launch before the iPhone 18. Perhaps Google could push up the launch of the Pixel 11 to late July 2026 to come in just under the wire and buy another year before it needs to be fully in compliance with the Pixel 12? Hey, with the recent news about
moving up in the schedule by multiple months, it’s certainly possible.
Remember that Google and Apple are not the only players on this field. All other OEMs will need to play ball, too.",pixel 9 look much like iphone blame eu thanks insight ifixit good possible explanation googles design decisions year lightbox_close close lightbox_next

1) upgraded to android 15. Feels more like a pixel 8s variant, not a major upgrade imho. If using 8 series I don't really see much incentive to upgrade
2) cameras haven't improved much and quite a big gap behind top competitors. Colors quite washed out and night mode not impressed. There's only so much software can do
3) Heat management,FP sensor and battery life have improved, but not say very impressive also. using without case, streaming a video sometimes will also heat up for no reason. 5 hour SOT with 5G Data barely last a day, squeeze an hour more with wifi 100%
4) processor upgraded but still experiencing microstutters here and there, have to force peak refresh rate, smooth display and animation scale to 0.5x in developer options then much smoother.It shouldn't happen to a flagship phone. Even playing games like MLBB also lag
5) Charging speed is still pathetic. Hope they come out with faster charging protocols for future models
6) Editing videos quite slow and heats up the phone too
7) Data connectivity and calls quality have improved a lot

“To cool down your phone, provide airflow to your phone if possible”

“Use only cases or covers made for your specific phone”

“To help cool your phone, close apps that use a lot of power like games or video streaming. You can reopen them later.”

“Protect your phone by putting it in an inner pocket close to your body, or using an insulated case”

“Let your phone rest and warm up for a few minutes before doing demanding tasks like gaming or video calls. This helps keep it safe from damage.”

Google has quietly revealed that your phone will occasionally ignore the charging limit feature.

The charging limit function caps charging at 80% capacity to slow battery degradation.

However, Google says your Pixel will sometimes charge to 100% capacity to “recalibrate estimated capacity.”

Google recently introduced a charging limits feature to the Pixel series, following in the footsteps of other Android OEMs and Apple. This feature only allows your battery to be charged to 80% capacity in the name of long-term
.
However, it turns out your Pixel will occasionally ignore your 80% limit and charge to 100%.
Android Authority
contributor AssembleDebug updated Google’s Settings Services app (version 1.1.0.697513890) and subsequently spotted updated text in the Charging optimization menu to reflect this change.

The good news is that Google isn’t doing this to annoy you. Instead, the updated text notes that this is done to “recalibrate” estimated capacity. In other words, your phone needs a full charge so you can get accurate data regarding estimated battery life and to prevent any issues/bugs. The last thing you want is for your phone to die because the predicted battery life was way off.
This isn’t the first time we’ve seen phones with charging limit functionality automatically charging to 100% capacity. Apple’s iPhones also occasionally hit a full charge with charging limits enabled. The company
that this is done to “maintain accurate battery state-of-charge estimates.”
In any event, we’re glad to see the charging limit feature coming to Pixel users as it’s a great way to slow battery degradation. Now, about Google bringing

The Google Pixel 9 Pro is the Android Authority Editor's Choice winner for best phone of 2024​
A big win for a certain smaller flagship.
By Oliver Cragg
Android Authority
‘s Editor’s Choice phone of the year 2024​



Ryan Haines / Android Authority


Four years at the top for a Pixel, but we’ve never seen such a dominant win as this. With just shy of double the amount of votes as our runner-up, the
takes the crown.
With the Pro-tier Pixel winning in 2022 and 2023, this isn’t a huge surprise — we’re obviously big Pixel fans here. However, what really stands out this year is the fact the Pixel 9 Pro managed such a massive points gap despite the vote being split for the first time ever
.
Yet, as much as we still loved the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL (mild spoiler for later in this list), the newly shrunken Pixel 9 Pro was the one that left the biggest impression. While it wasn’t exactly a return to the Pixel 5-style small phone form factor, Google learned all the best lessons from the iPhone Pro range and delivered a reasonably-sized flagship (with a hint of iPhone inspiration to the overall design), while still managing to squeeze in all the best of the series — Gemini, Tensor, the photography chops, the
in the business, and more.
So, congrats to Google and the Pixel 9 Pro, our Editor’s Choice smartphone of the year winner for 2024, and a phone that

limmk,2024-12-15T00:55:54+0800,"Foldable phones promise a lot — and in many ways, they deliver. But there’s a big gap between how you imagine you’ll use a foldable and how you actually do. Sure, I enjoyed reviewing presentations and navigating spreadsheets on the larger display. Split-screen multi-tasking using Open Canvas has been absolutely fantastic. Yet, for most tasks, I still reached for my laptop or tablet. That’s mostly due to the software lagging behind the hardware experience.
My smartphone use doesn't revolve around gaming, or oodles of media consumption, making the foldable display a nice-to-have, but not essential.
​
The truth is, my smartphone usage doesn’t revolve around gaming or binge-watching. For me, the folding screen became a feature I liked but didn’t truly need. Adding to this, the foldable required more careful handling than I was willing to give it.
The Pixel 9 Pro: Small Size, Big Impact​

The Pixel 9 Pro, on the other hand, keeps things refreshingly simple. Its 6.3-inch screen is just the right size for swiping through decks, browsing, and social media. With a bit of finagling, I can even review Excel sheets on it. But that’s a small compromise for the sheer portability of the phone.
Between foldables and large phones touching almost 7 inches in size, the
. It fits comfortably in my hand and in my not-upto-2024-standards skinny jeans. I can easily reach the top of the phone — something I haven’t been able to do in years. These might come across as small things, but they all add up. As my use case evolves, and I spend more and more time in front of my computer or tablet, I love a smartphone that prioritizes being a smartphone instead of an all-encompassing computer in my pocket.
The fact that all of that comes as a no-compromises flagship just makes it all the more excellent. You see, for the longest time, the only real option for a compact flagship was an iPhone. While I do have one foot in the iPhone world, my primary platform remains Android, and for a very long time, there was no real alternative. The Pixel 9 Pro is that phone. Moreover, this year, Google has seriously stepped up its game with the hardware quality so much that I have no qualms about chucking the phone about or tossing it on the couch when I’m unwinding for the day.


Of course, durability is just one aspect of a phone. The one feature that I’m not willing to compromise on is the camera. My camera might always be within reach, but my smartphone camera gets used multiple times a day to capture the neighborhood cat begging at my window for food or other funny moments. The Pixel 9 Pro gives the same full-featured camera as the full-size
with no cutbacks. For way too long, a compact phone has meant a nerfed sensor or gimped telephoto sensor. That’s not the case anymore, and I’m all in on it.
Between the long-lasting battery life, flagship camera, and good enough performance, the Pixel 9 Pro is a rare compact flagship in the Android world.
​
Google’s work on polishing the Pixel experience has also paid dividends. I had serious inhibitions over the Pixel 9 Pro’s battery life. The physical capacity is much lower than any phone I’ve used recently, and the Tensor chip isn’t known to be the most frugal around. However, battery life hasn’t been a concern at all.


A large part of that comes down to how I use my phone. Social media, browsing, phone calls, and music streaming don’t tax the processor nearly as much as games do. However, I absolutely did not expect to get a day and then some of use out of this phone. That’s, frankly, impressive.
I’m also delighted by the fact that I have access to wireless charging again. I’ve got
strewn across my house, and it’s my preferred way to top up a phone. Is it the most efficient way? No. But as someone who really only charges my phone overnight, it works for me. Sure, my other foldable, the
, does have wireless charging, but the arrangement of the coils makes it too cumbersome to align with most of my chargers. The Pixel 9 Pro, on the other hand, is effortless.
Compact, Powerful, and Perfectly Balanced​



The Pixel 9 Pro has reminded me why I love a phone that gets the basics right. Foldable phones like the OnePlus Open are undeniably impressive and fun to use, but for my day-to-day needs, the Pixel 9 Pro strikes the perfect balance between form and function. It’s compact, durable, and effortlessly capable, offering a no-compromise flagship experience in a size that feels just right.
The Pixel 9 Pro is a smartphone that excels at being just that. That’s exactly what I’ve been looking for.
​
Whether it’s the exceptional camera, the ease of wireless charging, or the portability that fits seamlessly into my lifestyle, the Pixel 9 Pro has become the ideal companion for how I use a phone today. It doesn’t try to be a tablet, a gaming rig, or a portable theater — it’s a smartphone that excels at being just that.

limmk,2024-12-17T01:08:23+0800,"You might be on the lookout for some decent or solid Pixel 9 accessories, luckily we’re way ahead of you and have tested lots of crud to find the gems. Here are a few more of our favorites that we think you might want to take a look at.


Accessories come in lots of shapes, sizes, and price points. The Pixel lineup has gained lots of accessories over the past few years, but the catalog of options still isn’t quite as deep as the iPhone. That said, we get inundated with requests and have tested hundreds since the launch earlier this year.
Popsocket MagSafe adapter​



Lots of cases for the Pixel 9 series now come with MagSafe connectivity as standard, but not all. With a ton of accessories out there that can connect to your Pixel 9 with the circle magnetic band, you might want to at least have the option to expand the capabilities of your phone. There are cheap metal rings that attach to your case, but Popsocket has the best colorways with a white or black adhesive ring that lets you pair more things to your phone.
These also look a little less “hacky” and aren’t out of place on the official Pixel 9 series case lineup. You can even just stick it directly on the back of your Pixel if you wanted to. It’s hard to argue with a $7 accessory that opens up a great array of accessories – which is always nice.

Gamesir X8+​



There is no way to sugarcoat it: most touchscreen controls for mobile games or emulators are trash. Gaming controller for Android come in lots of shapes and sizes. The Gamesir X8+ is on the larger side but it’s a Rolls Royce controller and the perfect companion for bigger, bulkier phones.
It’s very much in the mold of an Xbox gamepad but with the benefits of the split design, which turns your phone into a more capable Nintendo Switch. As a gamepad for emulation, there are few better. Hall Effect analog sticks ensure longevity, while the face buttons and triggers are super premium. It’s a Bluetooth gamepad, so you can use it with lots of your devices – including tablets.
The only downside is the pricing. At $80, this ain’t cheap so maybe the
might be a better buy at under half that for most people.

Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter​



One of my favorite accessories for Pixel has been a Uni USB-C to HDMI adapter. It’s a high-quality cable that I’ve used in hotels and when traveling to turn my phone into a little streaming box. The downside is the cable is large, and the output is limited to 4K at 30Hz. That’s why I switched it out recently for an Anker USB-C to HDMI adapter.
It’s smaller, supports 4K 60Hz output, and if you don’t want to carry a two-meter HDMI cable around, it’s more manageable. Most of the time when you can repurpose an existing cable at the back of your TV or in a hotel room. This is a better option if you prefer a minimal EDC that’ll work with all of your other tech. It also means you can choose a different cable if you want.

Xiaomi Sound Pocket speaker​



I usually take earbuds everywhere, but I recently picked up the Xiaomi Sound Pocket to throw in my bag while on vacation as a sort of “room speaker” when in a hotel room. Make no mistake, it’s not exactly the best speaker I’ve ever used, but it’s compact, has a handy lanyard to hang from a backpack strap or even a door handle, has a long-lasting battery, and even has an IP67 rating.
I actually paired it with my Pixel Tablet to get a basic in-room cinema experience while on vacation and it sounded pretty solid. It wasn’t bad at all! Sure, it won’t replace a Sonos system, but if you want to play some tune by the pool or, heck, in the shower, I think it’s a great little stocking stuffer to throw into your bag and just forget about until you want to blast some music while on the go. The best thing is that it’s one of those accessories that isn’t limited to the Pixel 9 series either.

Jsaux Foldable Phone Stand​



If you have the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or even the Pixel 9 Pro XL, a decent kickstand might not be a bad idea. I have been using a super nice Jsauc folding phone stand with the Fold, and it’s become a mainstay at my desk. For just $9, it’s not going to break the bank. It folds flat,t and it should take a beating. It’s really hard to fault.

Pela Eco-friendly Pixel protection​



Pela cases offer a unique blend of fun and eco-friendliness. Made from biodegradable “Flaxstic” material and shipped in sustainable packaging, these cases are a great choice for environmentally conscious Pixel 9 owners.
While the 2mm-thick design offers a good balance of protection and ergonomics, the lack of a power button insert or cover is a minor drawback compared to some other more expensive Pixel 9 accessories – although you could level greater criticism at Pitaka for huge cutouts. However, the variety of eye-catching designs and the use of unique materials make Pela cases a compelling option for those seeking a distinctive and sustainable case for their Pixel device.

Pitaka Premium paper-thin cases and covers​



Pitaka’s minimalist carbon fiber cases are a great option for those who want to preserve the Pixel 9’s design and improve handling without adding heft or the “bulky bits” we often associate with Pixel accessories. While they are expensive, their simple build and strong MagSafe connectivity make them a worthwhile investment for those seeking a premium, minimalist case.
While not the most protective, Pitaka cases offer a sleek, thin design that allows for seamless MagSafe accessory compatibility. Paired with a glass screen protector, this setup provides a balance between protection and aesthetics, making it a great choice for those who prioritize minimalism and style.

Mous Limitless 5.0​



The marketing is squarely focused on advanced Pixel protection and it’s hard to argue with Mous on this. One of the latest releases from the UK-based accessory maker is the Mous Limitless 5.0 case. It offers a robust level of protection, with a thick, rubbery design and raised edges to safeguard your Pixel 9 display from even the worse drops. The cases are also Made for Google Certified and boast impressive drop-test results – I even put this to the test way back during the Pixel 4 era and it passed with flying colors.
One of the standout features of Mous cases is their unique material options, including leather, fabric, carbon fiber, and wood. The bamboo variant, for example, offers a stylish and sustainable choice. While the cases are on the pricier side, they provide a premium look and feel, making them a worthwhile investment for those who prioritize both protection and aesthetics.",might lookout decent solid pixel 9 accessories luckily way ahead tested lots crud find gems favorites think might want take look accessories come lots shapes sizes price points pixel lineup gained lots accessories past years catalog options still isnt quite deep iphone said get inundated requests tested hundreds since launch earlier year popsocket magsafe adapter lots cases pixel 9 series come magsafe connectivity standard not ton accessories connect pixel 9 circle magnetic band might want least option expand capabilities phone cheap metal rings attach case popsocket best colorways white black adhesive ring lets pair things phone also look little less hacky arent place official pixel 9 series case lineup even stick directly back pixel wanted hard argue 7 accessory opens great array accessories always nice gamesir x8 no way sugarcoat touchscreen controls mobile games emulators trash gaming controller android come lots shapes sizes gamesir x8 larger side rolls royce controller perfect companion bigger bulkier phones much mold xbox gamepad benefits split design turns phone capable nintendo switch gamepad emulation better hall effect analog sticks ensure longevity face buttons triggers super premium bluetoth gamepad use lots devices including tablets downside pricing 80 aint cheap maybe might better buy half people anker usbc hdmi adapter one favorite accessories pixel uni usbc hdmi adapter highquality cable ive used hotels traveling turn phone little streaming box downside cable large output limited 4k 30hz thats switched recently anker usbc hdmi adapter smaller supports 4k 60hz output dont want carry twometer hdmi cable around manageable time repurpose existing cable back tv hotel room better option prefer minimal edc thatl work tech also means choose different cable want xiaomi sound pocket speaker usually take earbuds everywhere recently picked xiaomi sound pocket throw bag vacation sort room speaker hotel room make no mistake not exactly best speaker ive ever used compact handy lanyard hang backpack strap even door handle longlasting battery even ip67 rating actually paired pixel tablet get basic inrom cinema experience vacation sounded pretty solid wasnt bad sure wont replace sonos system want play tune pool heck shower think great little stocking stuffer throw bag forget want blast music go best thing one accessories isnt limited pixel 9 series either jsaux foldable phone stand pixel 9 pro fold even pixel 9 pro xl decent kickstand might not bad idea using super nice jsauc folding phone stand fold become mainstay desk 9 not going break bank folds flat take beating really hard fault pela ecofriendly pixel protection pela cases offer unique blend fun ecofriendlines made biodegradable flaxstic material shipped sustainable packaging cases great choice environmentally conscious pixel 9 owners 2mthick design offers good balance protection ergonomics lack power button insert cover minor drawback compared expensive pixel 9 accessories although could level greater criticism pitaka huge cutouts however variety eyecatching designs use unique materials make pela cases compelling option seeking distinctive sustainable case pixel device pitaka premium paperthin cases covers pitakas minimalist carbon fiber cases great option want preserve pixel 9s design improve handling without adding heft bulky bits often associate pixel accessories expensive simple build strong magsafe connectivity make worthwhile investment seeking premium minimalist case not protective pitaka cases offer sleek thin design allows seamless magsafe accessory compatibility paired glass screen protector setup provides balance protection aesthetics making great choice prioritize minimalism style mous limitless 50 marketing squarely focused advanced pixel protection hard argue mous one latest releases ukbased accessory maker mous limitless 50 case offers robust level protection thick rubbery design raised edges safeguard pixel 9 display even worse drops cases also made google certified boast impressive droptest results even put test way back pixel 4 era passed flying colors one standout features mous cases unique material options including leather fabric carbon fiber wood bamboo variant example offers stylish sustainable choice cases pricier side provide premium look feel making worthwhile investment prioritize protection aesthetics

The Arc Pulse bumpers are made of an outer aerospace-grade metal shell (aluminum 7075-T6 with high-end anti-scratch coatings) with an inner custom-engineered elastomer for a “friction-fit lock.” This is another highlight here – there is no sticky adhesive or anything like that to keep them in place. They “feature a unique pressure-fitting mechanism that securely locks the metal shell and elastomer inlay without the need for glue” in order to enhance durability and make “the case fully recyclable, aligning with our commitment to sustainability.”
Each Arc Pulse bumper ships as a two-piece package – you simply pop on the top bumper to safeguard the camera array and top corners of your device, and then follow suit along the bottom.",arc arc pulse bumper cases googles new arc pulse pixel 9 9 pro pixel 9 pro xl bumper cases among popular smartphone accessories around across 2024 finally ready google latest slate pixel 9 devices best using exclusive 9to510 code deliver head additional details closer look new arc pulse bumper case pixel 9 arc pulse bumper cases pixel 9 chance iphone version arc pulse earlier year loved every second youre bumper case vibes like see imagery likely wont disappointed best bumpers ever tested preorders new pixel 9 9 pro 9 pro xl arc pulse using code 9to510 checkout simply navigate menu top left corner select google pixel 9 device choice first round preorders placed begin shipping january 10 january 15 us orders receive free shipping lightbox_close close lightbox_next next lightbox_previous previous lightbox_eror requested content not loaded please try later lightbox_start_slideshow start slideshow lightbox_stop_slideshow stop slideshow lightbox_ful_scren full screen lightbox_thumbnails thumbnails lightbox_download download lightbox_share share lightbox_zom zoom lightbox_new_window new window lightbox_togle_sidebar toggle sidebar arc pulse bumpers made outer aerospacegrade metal shell aluminum 7075t6 highend antiscratch coatings inner customenginered elastomer frictionfit lock another highlight no sticky adhesive anything like keep place feature unique presurefiting mechanism securely locks metal shell elastomer inlay without need glue order enhance durability make case fully recyclable aligning commitment sustainability arc pulse bumper ships twopiece package simply pop top bumper safeguard camera array top corners device follow suit along bottom

limmk,2024-12-29T00:41:30+0800,"Some three months after launch, the “middle-child” Pixel 9 Pro has evolved into a polished, poised, Pixel. Here’s what it’s like to live with and whether it’s the best buy in the latest lineup.
Why revisit the device after a fairly short space of time? Well, since launch, the Pixel 9 Pro has gained the Android 15 update, and Google has pushed out regular updates, including a significant December Pixel Feature Drop, and bundled in some Gemini improvements.
Like many of its forebears, the Pixel 9 Pro is a different beast than it was at launch. Let’s dive into how this device has evolved as the last Pixel 9 series phone to hit the market.
Diminished size, but not in quality​
The Pixel 9 Pro sets a new benchmark for Google’s hardware, feeling robust and polished. The jury is out on the polished aluminum frame, but in tandem with the matte rear finish, it 100% exudes a certain high-end quality. For those worried about the glossy sides, the reality is that they are not as scratch-prone as you might have anticipated. They can take a beating more so than we anticipated, but a case keeps them safe and secure regardless of those worries.
Despite the diminutive size, the 9 Pro still feels assured, firm, and well-balanced. It’s also dually impressive that Google managed to compress the “high-end” hardware of this generation into the exact same frame as the Pixel 9. It’s something that doesn’t get old. You almost expect there to be some compromises but there aren’t any of real note.




An apt analogy is furniture: compare modern, often hollow furniture with the enduring quality of solid wood pieces. The Pixel 9 embodies that sturdy, substantial feel. From firm, clicky buttons to the matte finish on the visor (a significant improvement over previous Pro models’ scratch-prone glossy visor), and the flat side rails and boxy shape, it exudes a more mature, business-class aesthetic. Sure, we’ve lost the charm and approachability of the older, curvier Pixel, but there are obvious reasons for this change.
The old “iPhone of Android” trope always felt hamfisted in the past. Now, well, it’s right on the money. Personally, I’m, personally, a little disappointed with the copy-paste frame, but the the result? One of the best-built Android phones to date. We’re curious to see how Google raises the bar with the Pixel 10. Maybe Apple has been right all this time, and we’re only now starting to see the benefits of the enhanced shape.
We’ve rounded up some of our favorite accessories that aid your experience. This year, higher-quality extras seem more readily available, but we do need more as there’s a lack of choice from higher-end brands.
The Pixel 9 Pro also has probably the best 6.3-inch smartphone screen ever. In isolation, it’s excellent, but it’s a substantial improvement even compared to the regular Pixel 9. Over the past few months, it’s obvious that this has the highest PPI on the entire lineup this year. You just get all the benefits of the “Pro” tier and then some. Video content is best here. You lose some real estate – some of that thanks to changes in Android 15 – but with tangible benefits. It’s impossible to fault for small phone fans.
Everything from the build to the all-important size feels “just right.”",three months launch midlechild pixel 9 pro evolved polished poised pixel heres like live whether best buy latest lineup revisit device fairly short space time well since launch pixel 9 pro gained android 15 update google pushed regular updates including significant december pixel feature drop bundled gemini improvements like many forebears pixel 9 pro different beast launch lets dive device evolved last pixel 9 series phone hit market diminished size not quality pixel 9 pro sets new benchmark googles hardware feeling robust polished jury polished aluminum frame tandem matte rear finish 100 exudes certain highend quality worried glossy sides reality not scratchprone might anticipated take beating anticipated case keeps safe secure regardless worries despite diminutive size 9 pro still feels assured firm welbalanced also dualy impressive google managed compress highend hardware generation exact frame pixel 9 something doesnt get old almost expect compromises arent real note apt analogy furniture compare modern often hollow furniture enduring quality solid wood pieces pixel 9 embodies sturdy substantial feel firm clicky buttons matte finish visor significant improvement previous pro models scratchprone glossy visor flat side rails boxy shape exudes mature businesclas aesthetic sure weve lost charm approachability older curvier pixel obvious reasons change old iphone android trope always felt hamfisted past well right money personally im personally little disappointed copypaste frame result one bestbuilt android phones date curious see google raises bar pixel 10 maybe apple right time starting see benefits enhanced shape weve rounded favorite accessories aid experience year higherquality extras seem readily available need theres lack choice higherend brands pixel 9 pro also probably best 63inch smartphone screen ever isolation excellent substantial improvement even compared regular pixel 9 past months obvious highest pi entire lineup year get benefits pro tier video content best lose real estate thanks changes android 15 tangible benefits impossible fault small phone fans everything build alimportant size feels right
limmk,2024-12-29T01:25:15+0800,"Updated, enhanced, and purring with Android 15​





“This “just right” feeling extends to the software experience. Google’s continuous improvements across Android and its apps have resulted in an incredibly refined Pixel experience. This is a better phone than at launch because it practically had two Android overhauls.
One of the big highlights is that Google’s focus on seamless, background-operating features, leads you to increasingly use of features you might otherwise overlook.
It’s old hat now but a great example of this that has been around for almost a decade is the Now Playing function and how it automatically detects background music. It’s designed to work without input and feels in sync with what a “smartphone” should do. Call Screening answers calls on your behalf and connects only to important ones. The brand-new Pixel Screenshots meticulously organize your screenshots, eliminating manual effort and simplifying future retrieval. It does the legwork and the added analysis – although sometimes spotty – is more often than not a genuine timesaver.
Pixel Weather’s AI-powered weather summaries and precipitation map have proven invaluable for winter snow predictions. It might not be exclusive to the Pixel 9 series anymore, but it’s these things that make a Pixel a Pixel. You might not realize how valuable things are until you switch away.
Praise of these to one side. Some AI features on the Pixel 9 Pro, like Pixel Studio, Add Me, and Reimagine with Magic Editor, rare nice but a little underutilized, feeling more like enthusiast toys than practical tools. Nevertheless, the modern Pixel experience with Android 15 is stable, clean, and thoughtful. It’s a key factor in my continued use, and. as noted, you miss it when using other manufacturers’ devices. While customization options are limited compared to One UI, and feature depth may not match, it’s an OS that’s easy to fall in love with if expectations are tempered.


Google’s Tensor G4 chip is the foundation for these software features. By now, you know full well that this isn’t an out-and-out top-tier chip. Rightly or wrongly, Google’s approach has been slow with its internal chip efforts. That said, this is the first time we’ve had a “competent” chip in all areas since the introduction of the Tensor lineup. We’re tempting fate, but it’s highly unlikely you’ll encounter any significant issues with the Tensor G4.
While it may not handle the most demanding games like Genshin Impact or Warzone Mobile at maximum settings, you’ll still enjoy most games. Overheating in hot temperatures that lead to thermal throttling appear to be gone. Thermals remain stable even with data usage, data performance is more consistent, and battery life is predictable, averaging around 4-5 hours of screen-on time – which is a terrible metric but the best we have.
While faster charging would be desirable, it’s a minor gripe. These were the most significant issues with previous Tensor chips, and their absence is a significant improvement. And, of course, everyday performance is exceptional across social media, content consumption, and other tasks.
It isn’t the best chip, but in context it took Qualcomm a lot longer than 4 years to produce a “competent” and reliable SoC in the early days of Android. Without giving Samsung Foundry and Google a free pass, at least things are in a good place moving into the next generation and the switch to TSMC. The Pixel 9 Pro – and entire 9 series – does well within it’s limitations. The reality is; you’ll probably never notice a difference.
Pleasant experience aside, one of the few complaints that linger is that when testing out some of the suite of Android competitors since the Pixel 9 Pro launched in September 2024, you can see a difference in overall speed when loading and unloading apps. UFS 3.1 storage isn’t “slow” in the traditional sense, but it is noticeable if you have come from a recent OnePlus or Samsung phone for instance. It stills hurts that Google couldn’t give us that upgrade for the Pro lineup this time around. It’s a must for next year.
The full-fat Pixel camera​



Since Google decided to split things in 2021, a small Pixel with a complete camera has always felt like the dream. Without exaggerating too much, this has been the best decision in recent years. It’s simply awesome to have your cake and eat it, too.
Along with the XL, the Pixel 9 Pro has the most versatile Pixel camera yet. Being able to zoom without compromising still feels like magic on a phone this small.
It has become increasingly clear that Google’s camera lead has been effectively destroyed. By modern flagship Android phone standards, this isn’t the best. It’s barely even “Pro.” Instead, after an extensive period, it’s yet another exceptional “point and shoot” system that shouldn’t let you down no matter the situation. One thing that is obvious, though, is how the signature Pixel look has been diluted. Images are starting to feel more in sync with what other OEMs are doing on their own Android camera systems.
The camera’s ‘manual-lite’ mode simplifies settings adjustments for those less familiar with photography, but we’re still itching for a more in-depth set of controls that let us play around with a solid set of sensors and lenses.
Some issues exist. Nighttime photos still exhibit significant lens flare from background lights, potentially ruining or distracting from the image. This is particularly frustrating, given the camera’s obvious low-light capabilities. Another minor issue is the somewhat abrupt transitions between lenses during zooming. It’s great that Video Boost fixes that problem, but why do we need to process the video before that problem is diminished? It feels like a sloppy way to solve a problem that others have overcome without sending files off to be processed in the cloud.
Another weird quirk that still irks is the stark visual difference between what you see in the viewfinder and what a picture looks like when processed. Is this a limitation of the Tensor chip? Processing is way behind other phones. It dulls the sheen of what often feels like the complete small phone camera experience.
Is the Pixel 9 Pro the best high-end small phone ever?​
Lots of people have been clamoring to get hold of a smaller Pixel phones that doesn’t skimp on the extras, the tangible upgrades, and particularly the camera system.
A new form factor poses lots of questions pre-and-post launch that can’t always be answered right away. The addition of Android 15 to the Pixel 9 Pro has added to the allure. It’s a better buy because of the numerous updates. It’s also the perfect contrast to the ballooning behemoth slabs that most Android phones have become in recent years.
It helps that Google has maintained momentum this year and well into its “maturity era.” The Pixel 9 Pro was sold out for a while after launch, and rightfully so. This feels like the best of the bunch this time because it does something different. If anything, the 9 Pro has proven to us that bigger isn’t always better.",updated enhanced purring android 15 right feeling extends software experience googles continuous improvements across android aps resulted incredibly refined pixel experience better phone launch practically two android overhauls one big highlights googles focus seamless backgroundoperating features leads increasingly use features might otherwise overlook old hat great example around almost decade playing function automatically detects background music designed work without input feels sync smartphone call screening answers calls behalf connects important ones brandnew pixel screnshots meticulously organize screnshots eliminating manual effort simplifying future retrieval legwork added analysis although sometimes spotty often not genuine timesaver pixel weathers aipowered weather summaries precipitation map proven invaluable winter snow predictions might not exclusive pixel 9 series anymore things make pixel pixel might not realize valuable things switch away praise one side ai features pixel 9 pro like pixel studio add reimagine magic editor rare nice little underutilized feeling like enthusiast toys practical tools nevertheless modern pixel experience android 15 stable clean thoughtful key factor continued use noted miss using manufacturers devices customization options limited compared one ui feature depth may not match os thats easy fall love expectations tempered googles tensor g4 chip foundation software features know full well isnt outandout toptier chip rightly wrongly googles approach slow internal chip efforts said first time weve competent chip areas since introduction tensor lineup tempting fate highly unlikely youl encounter significant issues tensor g4 may not handle demanding games like genshin impact warzone mobile maximum settings youl still enjoy games overheating hot temperatures lead thermal throttling appear gone thermals remain stable even data usage data performance consistent battery life predictable averaging around 45 hours screnon time terrible metric best faster charging would desirable minor gripe significant issues previous tensor chips absence significant improvement course everyday performance exceptional across social media content consumption tasks isnt best chip context took qualcom lot longer 4 years produce competent reliable soc early days android without giving samsung foundry google free pass least things good place moving next generation switch tsmc pixel 9 pro entire 9 series well within limitations reality youl probably never notice difference pleasant experience aside one complaints linger testing suite android competitors since pixel 9 pro launched september 2024 see difference overall speed loading unloading aps ufs 31 storage isnt slow traditional sense noticeable come recent oneplus samsung phone instance stills hurts google couldnt give us upgrade pro lineup time around must next year fulfat pixel camera since google decided split things 2021 small pixel complete camera always felt like dream without exaggerating much best decision recent years simply awesome cake eat along xl pixel 9 pro versatile pixel camera yet able zoom without compromising still feels like magic phone small become increasingly clear googles camera lead effectively destroyed modern flagship android phone standards isnt best barely even pro instead extensive period yet another exceptional point shoot system shouldnt let no matter situation one thing obvious though signature pixel look diluted images starting feel sync oems android camera systems cameras manualite mode simplifies settings adjustments less familiar photography still itching indepth set controls let us play around solid set sensors lenses issues exist nighttime photos still exhibit significant lens flare background lights potentially ruining distracting image particularly frustrating given cameras obvious lowlight capabilities another minor issue somewhat abrupt transitions lenses zooming great video boost fixes problem need process video problem diminished feels like sloppy way solve problem others overcome without sending files processed cloud another weird quirk still irks stark visual difference see viewfinder picture looks like processed limitation tensor chip processing way behind phones dulls sheen often feels like complete small phone camera experience pixel 9 pro best highend small phone ever lots people clamoring get hold smaller pixel phones doesnt skimp extras tangible upgrades particularly camera system new form factor poses lots questions preandpost launch cant always answered right away addition android 15 pixel 9 pro added allure better buy numerous updates also perfect contrast ballooning behemoth slabs android phones become recent years helps google maintained momentum year well maturity era pixel 9 pro sold launch rightfully feels like best bunch time something different anything 9 pro proven us bigger isnt always better

First in line will be Google’s annual budget release, the

that a
Flip-style foldable Pixel
could be coming in 2025, but evidence on that has been slim in the time since.
Something that’s likely not coming in 2025 is a new Pixel Tablet, as Google’s plans for the next sequel have reportedly been shelved (though future tablets may still be coming).
Beyond that, it’s also very likely we’ll get a
Pixel Watch 4
sometime in the new year, and there’s always a chance of new earbuds too. The Pixel Buds A-Series are certainly due for a refresh, assuming Google wants to keep that budget option available, but there’s no word on that just yet. There are also those elusive
Pixel Tablet accessories
, the stylus and keyboard,
, but haven’t been released.
Android 16’s early release (for all)​
Google has already confirmed that Android 16
. The company mentioned that this will “better align with the schedule of device launches,” strongly hinting that Pixel 10 will probably stick with its August release window as was established by 2024’s Pixel 9 series.
By the end of 2025, there will be another “minor SDK” release for Android 16.
Currently,
ahead of final builds coming sometime after April 2025.
This update is also noteworthy because it applies everywhere, as Google is bringing this release to every Tensor-powered Pixel phone, including the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro which

Google Tensor’s next big step​
One of the most important things coming in 2025 for Google Pixel is a big step forward for Tensor chips.
, Google is shifting from a partnership with Samsung which provided a foundation in Exynos for Tesnor chipsets to a fully custom design that Google will produce through TSMC.
In theory, this should boost battery life through better efficiency, as well as providing Google an opportunity to focus even closer on its priorities for what a Pixel chipset should do.
We already know quite a bit about “Tensor G5.”
Leaks have revealed that the chip will be based on
and would have a

Project Astra and more Gemini​
AI continues to be a key focus for Google in the Pixel lineup, and 2025 will see Google expanding this further. There are surely
a lot
of Gemini features coming, but one of the most important is Project Astra, which
will be coming in 2025.
Project Astra was

What are you looking forward to?​
What else might be coming in 2025? Looking at the software side of things, there’s plenty of room for Google to introduce new features especially in the vein of Gemini.

is “twice as durable as Pixel 8,” with Google crediting the new design language. A new blog post from the company this week
.
The Product Integrity Engineering team is tasked with making “sure Pixel phones will survive day-to-day wear and tear.” This involves creating and performing stress, durability, and temperature tests. The process starts with “trying to really understand all the scenarios in which a customer is going to use our products.”
This is called Design
, with an emphasis on practical situations and tests. Google is not necessarily designing for edge cases that most people won’t encounter.
Specific tests Google shared include:
“…a robotic arm slid[ing] a tablet in and out of a backpack over and over again to simulate unpacking or packing your bag at the start of each day.”

“…drop several tablets from a low height over and over again to see how they’d hold up to small drops.”

“…machine [that] uses a motor to vigorously shake devices to see how they survive.”

There’s a high altitude test to see “what happens to our phones at 14,000 feet, for instance, because if there’s an unpressurized aircraft that’s transporting our phones, we don’t want them to break.”
On the temperature front, there’s testing to see how “devices survive at temperatures ranging from -30ºC (-22ºF) to 75ºC (167ºF).” That translates to real-world scenarios like “accidentally leav[ing] your phone out in the sun on a hot summer’s day, or subject[ing] your Pixel to rapid temperature changes when you leave your toasty home for the frigid outdoors in the winter.”

limmk,2025-02-03T05:07:37+0800,"Phone cases are a dime a dozen, and most don't go out of the way to look too unique. Occasionally, you might find a really nice thin case or one that slaps your favorite movie characters on the back, but what if you removed 90% of the case and could still protect your phone?
I first heard of the Arc Pulse case when the company teased its Galaxy S25 Arc Pulse case
, and while that case isn't available yet, the company does sell its cases for the Galaxy S24 series, Google Pixel 9 series, and several different iPhones.
These ultra-minimalist cases are built out of Aluminum 7075-T6 and feature a rubber-like Elastomer inlay to keep them snuggly attached to the phone at all times. The case design is so outlandish there was no way I could pass up the opportunity to test it, and I'm sure glad I did.
The drop test​
Let's just get right to business, shall we?
I don't often drop test phones in cases because so many cases are very similar, but Arc Pulse is a different beast entirely. For the test, I dropped the phone on three different flooring types: a wood floor, an area rug placed on concrete, and bare concrete. I dropped it at pocket height, roughly 3ft, and at head height, roughly 6ft, to simulate the two most common ways someone might drop their phone.
To my surprise, the
was spotless after all these drops. No scratches, cracks, or any other damage was found, and the case's unique design is surprisingly effective.
The case is designed to primarily protect the corners of the phone, with a lip around the front and back to keep the glass surfaces from coming into contact with any surface.
Of course, being so exposed in most places means that it will certainly not survive a drop onto an uneven surface if the screen or back glass hits a rock or something similar. In other words, you'll want to pair this case with one of the
to ensure that screen doesn't get shattered.
Because of the metal construction, the Arc Pulse case feels incredibly high quality and is as shiny as those side rails on your
, matching the aesthetic quite nicely. Corner coverage works well because of the weight, helping ensure it most often falls on one of the corners rather than flat on the front or back.
I've purposefully dropped it about a dozen times now and haven't seen a time when it fell flat on its face or back. Even if I dropped the phone flat, it would angle to one of the corners naturally before hitting the ground.


After several drops on the concrete, a crack developed in the top left corner of the Arc Pulse case. This isn't terribly surprising given the sheer weight of the phone and the case together being dropped on hard concrete. Metal is more protective but it's also more rigid than the usual materials used to make a phone case.
The result is the potential to crack if dropped on other rigid surfaces a lot, but the case has still held together very well despite this damage. Despite the ultra minimalist coverage, I'm super confident about the Arc Pulse case's ability to protect my phone. I was extremely nervous dropping it on concrete but it survived every attempt without scratching or damaging the phone at all, even from 6ft up.

TL;DR
Pixel users have been reporting persistent display stuttering issues, especially when scrolling through apps.

An Android kernel developer traced the issue to a wrong function in Tensor’s exynos_bts driver code, causing bandwidth management problems on Pixel devices.

He has suggested a fix that could resolve the problem, but Google needs to take notice.

limmk,2025-02-25T07:22:51+0800,"Summary​
Google is accused of limiting refresh rates on non-Pro Pixel demo units in stores.

A video shows the Pixel 9 looking less smooth than the Pixel 9 Pro despite similar specs.

Multiple users reported the issue on various Pixel models at Best Buy and Verizon stores.

Ever since the release of the Google Pixel 8, all Pixel smartphones have featured 120Hz refresh rate displays, including the mid-range
. While the A-series uses a slightly lower-quality panel compared to the standard and Pro models, all Pixel phones support 120Hz refresh rates.
However, it seems Google might be limiting the refresh rate on non-Pro models, including the entry-level flagship
and Pixel 9, in store demo units to push customers toward the more expensive Pro models.
Over the weekend, a
accused Google of intentionally forcing lower refresh rates on non-Pro Pixel demo units, even when the Smooth Display option is enabled. A video shared by YouTube user
shows the Pixel 9's screen looking less smooth than the Pixel 9 Pro, despite both having the high refresh rate option turned on.
The video shows both devices with Smooth Display enabled. But even with the same chipset and display panels, the Pixel 9 Pro appeared noticeably smoother than the standard
. The video was slowed down to highlight the difference, and it's pretty obvious.
This could be a sneaky move from Google​
What's more interesting is that this doesn't seem to be an isolated incident. Multiple replies on the Reddit thread
across different Pixel models, including the Pixel 8/8 Pro, Pixel Fold, Pixel 9/9 Pro, and
at various Best Buy locations and a Verizon store. One user even
to notice the same issue despite checking demo units at three different stores across two countries.
While we can't confirm this behavior just yet, if true, it feels like a shady tactic by Google to push users toward the more expensive Pro models. Most customers likely wouldn't notice the difference unless comparing the devices side by side, but it's still misleading to sway people into buying the pricier option.

limmk,2025-03-06T02:47:54+0800,"Google’s presence at MWC 2025 in Barcelona has not gone unnoticed. The company made a few
and while there, Google has collected two MWC awards from GLOMO, including one for the Pixel 9 Pro.
There isn’t anything new to show in terms of hardware from Google’s attendance at MWC unless you count the many Android figurines sprawled across the company’s event space. Still, there is no new phone, new tablet, or smart home devices to report on, because all of that would come during Made by Google. Instead, Google got some recognition for a couple of mile markers this year.
Google was
at MWC 2025. The awards program has been going on for 30 years, and it comes with some pedigree. First, Google won the “Smartphone of the Year” award for the Pixel 9 Pro. This comes as the Pixel 8 series won the “Best Smartphone” category from
. The year before that, Apple took the podium but has since not been awarded.
The
has been one of the best Android devices to come out of last year. It packs a ton of needed features with new AI tools baked throughout a good software experience. On the hardware side, it lacks little and just feels good to use. Comparing it to devices from Samsung and OnePlus, the Pixel 9 Pro is a really good choice, especially with the presence of Gemini.
Google Gemini also gets a GLOMO award at MWC with the “Breakthrough Device Innovation” award. This category is awarded all over the place between software and hardware, though AI requires a powerful blend of the two. In 2024, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 won the innovation award, with Apple’s Satellite SOS winning the year before. The achievement is awarded based on a few criteria, like “contribution to overall device performance and appeal,” as well as “product usefulness in terms of functionality and features.” Gemini has proven to be those things, and Google has done a good job of
.
Ideally, this will push Google to develop a strong contender for the next set of awards with the Pixel 10 series and further develop Gemini to be even more useful through the ecosystem.",googles presence mwc 2025 barcelona not gone unnoticed company made google collected two mwc awards glomo including one pixel 9 pro isnt anything new show terms hardware googles attendance mwc unles count many android figurines sprawled across companys event space still no new phone new tablet smart home devices report would come made google instead google got recognition couple mile markers year google mwc 2025 awards program going 30 years comes pedigree first google smartphone year award pixel 9 pro comes pixel 8 series best smartphone category year apple took podium since not awarded one best android devices come last year packs ton needed features new ai tools baked throughout good software experience hardware side lacks little feels good use comparing devices samsung oneplus pixel 9 pro really good choice especially presence gemini google gemini also gets glomo award mwc breakthrough device innovation award category awarded place software hardware though ai requires powerful blend two 2024 qualcoms snapdragon 8 gen 3 innovation award apples satellite sos winning year achievement awarded based criteria like contribution overall device performance appeal well product usefulness terms functionality features gemini proven things google done good job ideally push google develop strong contender next set awards pixel 10 series develop gemini even useful ecosystem
