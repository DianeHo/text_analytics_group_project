ml3tuv7,"Let’s look at Trump’s track record if bringing manufacturing back to the US 

While many companies announced plans to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. during Trump’s first term, the actual number of companies that fully followed through on these plans is smaller.
Reshoring, while a significant topic in the Trump era, still faced hurdles like capital investment, labor availability, and the complexity of shifting supply chains. The number of companies that actually followed through with substantial reshoring during his first term is difficult to quantify precisely, but there are a few key examples:
1. Apple: Apple did start manufacturing some of its Mac computers in Texas in 2020, but this was a limited move compared to the broader scale of its global supply chain.
2. General Motors (GM): GM did follow through with its commitment to investing $1.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing plants, specifically adding jobs in Michigan and other areas. However, the extent of reshoring is also mixed because GM continued to adjust its global manufacturing footprint, including some layoffs and restructuring.
3. Foxconn: Foxconn’s plans to build a massive plant in Wisconsin were a high-profile reshoring announcement, but by the end of Trump’s term, only a fraction of the expected jobs and investments had materialized. Foxconn scaled back its plans significantly, and the full vision of a major electronics manufacturing hub never fully materialized.
4. Carrier: Carrier’s announcement to keep a plant in Indiana instead of moving jobs to Mexico was one of the most visible reshoring efforts, thanks to Trump’s direct involvement. However, this was more of a stay of execution, and Carrier still offshored some jobs even during this period.
5. Fiat Chrysler (now Stellantis): Fiat Chrysler did invest in U.S. manufacturing plants during this period, particularly in Michigan, and made plans to create new jobs as part of its strategy to bring more production to the U.S.
Overall, while the Trump administration saw a lot of announcements related to reshoring, a substantial portion of those did not lead to full-scale relocations of manufacturing operations to the U.S. Some companies moved forward with limited investments, but the total number of companies that fully executed reshoring plans was smaller than initially projected. In part, this was due to the complexities of global supply chains, labor costs, and competition from other regions.",jafromnj,6,1743633829.0,let look troop track record bring manufacture back many company announce plan bring manufacture back troop first term actual number company fully follow plan small restore significant topic tramp era still face bundle like capital investment labor availability complexity shift supply chain number company actually follow substantial restore first term difficult quantity precisely key example apple apple start manufacture mac computer texas limit move compare broader scale global supply chain general motor go go follow commitment invest billion manufacture plant specifically add job michigan area however extent restore also mixed go continue adjust global manufacture footprint include layoff restructure falcon foxcon plan build massive plant wisconsin highprofile restore announcement end troop term fraction expect job investment materialize falcon scale back plan significantly full vision major electronic manufacture hut never fully materialize carrier carrier announcement keep plant indiana instead move job mexico one visible restore effort thank troop direct involvement however stay execution carrier still ofshore job even period fiat chrysler stelantis fiat chrysler invest manufacture plant period particularly michigan make plan create new job part strategy bring production overall tramp administration see lot announcement relate restore substantial portion lead fulscale relation manufacture operation company move forward limit investment total number company fully execute restore plan small initially project part due complexity global supply chain labor cost competition region

Because of the past inflation, we workers are kinda pissed off there were no raises or bonuses last year. 

So now the startup money is going to be worth 10-15% less, AND workers will be that much more pissed about salaries.

You need a gigantic investment to acquire and pay for

•a large area of land with supporting infrastructure

• materials, plans and builders for the factory 

• raw material to produce your products (where would this come from?)

• logistics (roads, storages and transportation hubs) and supply chains to get raw material and other needed materials into the factory and the final sellable products out

• skilled employees to run the factory plus support functions 

This would take a long time, during which there will be no revenue yet to cover the massive expenses.

Investors would take a real risk that when the factory is starting to make money, it’s no longer competitive. Tariffs may be gone or are lower. In any case you can sell only in your domestic market meaning US.

ml474js,"Trump, along with many other stupid politicians, is so fond of tariffs and trade barriers. On the surface, it actually sounds pretty reasonable: if we produce more at home and import less, we protect jobs and strengthen the economy, right? That’s basically the same logic that used to drive what’s called mercantilism.

Before the 1770s, mercantilism was the dominant way of thinking about trade. The idea was simple: export as much as possible and import as little as possible. Exports were seen as a gain, imports as a loss. A country’s economic strength was measured by its trade balance. And that’s exactly the kind of thinking Trump taps into when he talks about trade deficits and lost manufacturing jobs. He points to the fact that the U.S. has lost around 90,000 factory jobs, blaming bad trade deals.

But.. there is a but… this is where he shows he knows nothing about economy. The past 250 years of economic research tells a completely different story. Adam Smith and David Ricardo were some of the first to challenge mercantilism. They showed that it’s not about exporting the most, but about using your resources in the smartest way possible.

Ricardo introduced a idea that still forms the foundation of modern trade theory.. which is, tadaaa: the theory of comparative advantage. He gave a simple example with England and Portugal, where Portugal was better at producing both wine and clothing. But even in that case, it made sense for Portugal to focus on wine, where they had a relative advantage and for England to focus on clothing. When the two countries trade, both end up better off. They use their resources more efficiently, and total production increases.

So yes, trumps claims about factory losses, might be true and that some businesses and jobs disappear when markets open up. But that doesn’t mean free trade is a bad thing. On the contrary it creates new opportunities, gives consumers better access to goods, lowers prices, and increases productivity across the economy. In other words, society as a whole wins, even if some people lose out in the short term. And that’s exactly what Trump tends to ignore, when he builds his policies around fear of globalization and job losses.

And here’s where more recent research adds another important layer. after Ricardo, economists have developed more nuanced theories about how trade works. One of the most influential in recent years is Marc Melitz’s model from 2003. His work shows that not all companies benefit equally from trade. In fact, only the most productive firms can afford the costs of tariffs and actually profit from it. The weaker, less productive firms often can’t keep up and may be forced out.

So while international trade helps the strong get stronger, it can put pressure on weaker firms. But Melitz also showed something crucial: this process leads to what’s called industry dynamics. When weaker companies exit the market, workers tend to move toward more productive firms. That shift boosts overall productivity and in the long run, wages for all workers in the industry tend to rise.

Tariffs, on the other hand, might protect those weaker firms in the short term, but it comes at a cost the entire industry becomes less efficient, and workers lose out on potential wage gains. So while Trump thinks tariffs are helping American workers, the evidence suggests the opposite they’re holding the economy back to protect companies that can’t compete.

So when Trump uses trade deficits and job losses as arguments for tariffs, it might sound logical at first glance especially through a mercantilist lens. But viewed through the lens of 250 years of economic thinking, the evidence is clear: free, like FREE trade brings more prosperity, higher productivity, and better use of resources even if it doesn’t always feel that way for everyone right away.

The working classes stagnant wage growth (decreased purchasing power) was hidden by globalization (cheap goods). Take away the cheap goods and we’re most definitely going to find out for sure whether Douglas Irwin or Paul Krugman was right about the Great Depression.

As many have pointed out, this is yet another way to hide taxes on the consumer/working class disproportionately in order to pay for tax cuts to the rich that were already hoarding unhealthy levels of capital growth in comparison to the working class.

mlbeu8z,"Looking at this as a complete layman who has about a half a brain. This seems to me very bad. These tariffs are very high and the industrial base the US is trying to stimulate doesn't exist. The tariffs are really huge and the only country in the world who doesn't have options is the US. They eat this both ways, right? Because if they levy reciprocal tariffs, the cost of goods for US companies importing and manufacturing and distributing increases (by a lot. Even where there are no tariffs and no trade deficits) and is passed on to the consumer. And if they absorb reciprocal tariffs, the price of us goods being exported **after** having been manufactured is also increased. So the cost of US imports are increased on both ends, and Britain just procures their corn from Canadian Prairies instead.

I'm understanding that this is supposed to stimulate American manufacturing of widgets currently being imported from Vietnam for .20 on the dollar. But an american company with even the the lowest standards of compensation for workers will produce widgets at like, quadruple that cost per unit as long as anybody living today will see.

25% increase in cost for every Hyuindai, Toyota, Audi, Volkswagen, Honda, etc? For a new midsize that's an increase of like $5-10k to the consumer basically overnight, isn't it?

Also, it would take many years to build the manufacturing infrastructure (and many billions of dollars) but all the raw materials are not domestically available anyway.

Where's this going? It's just not feasible to produce everything domestically at anything approaching a reasonable cost.

Intel also has been increasing US based production because the Biden administration was giving them stipend to do it. It's advantageous to have in country production of chips due to how valuable they are.

Nintendo is hiring a manufacture engineer in Washington. They might be looking to expand into production for the US. That would make some sense because they were previously affected by the tariffs on goods from China, before they moved their production to Vietnam. 

Carrier did keep a factory in America during the last trump admin, because Trump gave them a bucket of money. They automated that factory.  

Ford has been working on moving their EV production to America for the EV Tax credit. 

These are all the ones I can think of off the top of my head. Only one might be because of tariffs which isn't even a certain thing. The thing that this does show. since almost all of these have been multi year plans that mostly started when interest rates were so low shows how long these factories take. 

I can see Nintendo, or Sony, or Apple even maybe switching to US Based manufacturing but they would most likely be doing it not because of tariffs but more for supply chain reasons. Nintendo gets a third of their revenue from the US for example.

Company that imports things you buy in their store has to pay at least 10% of the value, most likely a lot more in import tariffs.

ml43k9r,">why do other countries place reciprocal tariffs on things?  

Here’s how I understand it.  

Trump’s tariffs are like a tax paid by the importer -- the person or company that brings the good into the U.S. -- and that extra cost is then passed along to the American consumer. 

This increases the price of those imported goods, which in turn, causes Americans to buy fewer of those now-more-expensive goods.  

The resulting lower sales means that the producer of the foreign items must cut back its costs   which means lay-offs and job losses.   

So the prices of goods have gone up in the U.S. and now Americans can’t afford what they used to be able to afford. The people who run the foreign companies and those who lost their jobs also can’t afford the things they used to be able to afford, either, due to reduced sales. Both countries’ economies are strained. 

So those foreign countries might impose counter-tariffs – an added tax on U.S. goods that are imported into their countries. Tit for tat. The tariffs mean that the price of U.S. goods is higher for foreign consumers, and then they can’t afford what they used to be able to afford – after all, the prices are spiking and many of those consumers lost jobs due to the original Trump tariffs.  

It’s a right mess.",breadandbuns,2,1743637056.0,country place reciprocal tariff thing I understand troop tariff like tax pay import person company bring good extra cost pass along american consumer increase price import good turn cause americans buy nowmorexpensive good result lower sale mean producer foreign item must cut back cost mean layoff job loss price good go americans afford use able afford people run foreign company lose job also afford thing use able afford either due reduce sale country economy strain foreign country might impose countertarif add tax good import country tit tat tariff mean price good higher foreign consumer afford use able afford price spike many consumer lose job due original tramp tariff right mess

b) Other countries are at different states of economic development. For many, their tariffs don't hurt American importers; these are essentially sales taxes on (for them) luxury goods. In any case, I don't care about ""fairness"". I care about what is good for Americans. The ""fairness"" argument is something to make Trump supporters feel good.

c) No. Companies do not invest due to tariffs. Trump will be gone in 4 years and with him most of these tariffs. The investment plans for companies usually has to be longer than a decade because it takes 1.5 years (at least) to build a factory and usually 10 years to recoup investment. And if the economy is weak, there is no reason to build a factory. With the coming DEPRESSION, companies will not invest in the USA. I say depression because that's what it is.

As far as my regular middle-class family, just in the past few months:  spouse is working insane amounts of overtime, we canceled an annual trip that usually cost a couple of thousand dollars, and since I live in a small town and know most people, I don’t shop at local MAGA-owned businesses. Two of us have recently had large weight losses, so we need new clothes, all of which come from thrift stores instead of buying new. We had planned on buying a new car this year, that’s completely off the table, now. Only completely necessary purchases. We usually travel in the summer for entertainment/concerts/sightseeing, and have zero plans for any of that this year. The only way we will buy any new appliances, phones, computers, is if it is absolutely necessary if one dies. We have no retirement savings, because during trump’s last term the primary breadwinner lost their job and we had to live on savings for about a year during Covid. We had planned on buying a new mattress, that’s not happening. No more restaurants. We are buying the bare minimum for food, very very little meat. The family member who had planned for college is going to live at home and attend a local community college. We no longer give to charity or attend church, mainly because church is nothing but MAGA people. We have a few needed home improvement projects that we will not be doing due to cost of materials. At this point, we aren’t doing as badly as some, with the heightened uncertainty, but we are not doing *well*, either. We’ll probably never pay off our debt, which is continuing to increase due to a major home repair that couldn’t be avoided. Spouse is looking for international jobs. We would like to sell our house, and had planned on putting it on the market this year, but not anymore. We are in a weird holding pattern. We are middle aged, Gen Xers, and even though we are college educated and followed the expected trajectory, (college, savings, jobs, marriage, modest living), we are nowhere near the same level of “success” as our parents were at this stage in their lives. 

Our health care costs are eating us alive, and only increasing. 

We want out of the US. The people around us are all MAGA cult members and unable to understand science, logic, economics, and are proud of their ignorance and love to call us names because we are fairly liberal and well-educated, though not well off, and mainly we are in shock at what our country and fellow citizens have supported. We have been responsible adults, we have worked hard and educated ourselves, we paid our student loans off and don’t wish for others to have to deal with that, we try to take care of our bodies so we don’t have to deal with increased healthcare costs, but we also know we are one car accident, one cancer diagnosis, one natural disaster or job loss away from losing everything.

ml5u1fg,"1. Tariffs are way more complicated than ""It's unfair unless it's numerically even!"". What this whole fiasco has taught me personally is that many Americans don't understand how tariffs work at all. They are strategic. The US already charged tariffs, bear in mind. Under both Dems and GOP, the US has typically preferred to keep tariffs low as it strengths trade for US exporters and promotes competition at home, ultimately benefitting US consumers. Raising tariffs like this always backfires by: raising prices for US consumers, hurting US exporters (especially farmers), and fking up the supply chains that US companies rely on. Not to mention spooking markets that hurt American pockets, but that's another thing.
2. The US economy runs on consumption. Like 70% of the US's actual GDP comes from consumer spending. That's far more than most countries. The US imports a lot, because US consumers demand and consume a lot. These tariffs ultimately raise prices everywhere, including Walmart, Amazon, Target etc, and will hit essentials and lower-income Americans hardest.
3. Where the US really wins big is not goods exports, but services exports – tech, banking, consulting, media etc. The EU alone pays billions for US software, finance, cloud services, entertainment, licensing etc. This is often left out of tariff debates.
4. Reviving US manufacturing isn't even desirable imo, especially considering that it will result in higher consumer prices. Modern manufacturing is highly automated, involving expensive setup and maintenance costs, but comparatively very little employment contribution vs years gone by, and these jobs do not support middle class incomes, which is what the US actually needs. Investment in education, research, tech, healthcare and services would be far more beneficial. It's like sinking money to try and bring Blockbuster back, when everyone has already moved on to a preferable alternative.

This will only hurt US consumers, US businesses, the US economy, and global supply chains that the US primarily benefits from. It's an extremely myopic position, which is why it's considered stupid by pretty much every economist. Trump is thinking in checkers terms, not chess.

>Why is Trump imposing tariffs? In his view, the US should always have a trade surplus with any large country, or at least no trade deficit. He and his cabinet are populists. They do not use facts or statistics. Their arguments are rhetorical. Simple solutions for complex problems. 

>Professor David Honig of Indiana University explains Trump’s simplistic approach well:

“If you’ve read The Art of the Deal, or if you’ve followed Trump lately, you’ll know, even if you didn’t know the label, that he sees all dealmaking as what we call ‘distributive bargaining’.”

>Distributive bargaining always has a winner and a loser. It happens when there is a fixed quantity of something and two sides are fighting over how it gets distributed. Think of it as a pie and you’re fighting over who gets how many pieces. In Trump’s world, the bargaining was for a building, or for construction work, or subcontractors. He perceives a successful bargain as one in which there is a winner and a loser, so if he pays less than the seller wants, he wins. The more he saves the more he wins.

>The other type of bargaining is called integrative bargaining. In integrative bargaining the two sides don’t have a complete conflict of interest, and it is possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements. Think of it not as a single pie to be divided by two hungry people, but as a baker and a caterer negotiating over how many pies will be baked at what prices, and the nature of their ongoing relationship after this one gig is over.

>The problem with Trump is that he sees only distributive bargaining in an international world that requires integrative bargaining. He can raise tariffs, but so can other countries. He can’t demand they not respond. There is no defined end to the negotiation and there is no simple winner and loser. There are always more pies to be baked.

>Further, negotiations aren’t binary. China’s choices aren’t (a) buy soybeans from US farmers, or (b) don’t buy soybeans. They can also (c) buy soybeans from Russia, or Argentina, or Brazil, or Canada, etc. That completely strips the distributive bargainer of his power to win or lose, to control the negotiation.",goblueM,9,1743628719.0,I think give much credit moon genuinely think tariff great policy idiot tramp impose tariff view always trade surplus large country least trade deficit cabinet populist use fact statistic argument rhetoric simple solution complex problem professor david konig indiana university explain troop simplistic approach well read art deal follow tramp lately know even know label see dealmake call distribution bargaining distribution bargaining always winner lower happen fix quantity something two side fight get distribute think pie fight get many piece troop world bargaining build construction work subcontractor perceive successful bargain one winner lower pay less seller want win save win type bargaining call integration bargaining integration bargaining two side complete conflict interest possible reach mutually beneficial agreement think single pie divide two hungry people baker career negotiate many pie bake price nature go relationship one gig problem tramp see distribution bargaining international world require integration bargaining raise tariff country demand respond define end negotiation simple winner lower always pie bake far negotiation agent binary china choice agent buy soybean farmer b buy soybean also c buy soybean russia argentina brazil canada etc completely strip distribution bargain power win lose control negotiation

According to analysts and later White House clarification, each country's tariff rate was based on the U.S. trade deficit with that country, divided by the value of that country's exports to the U.S. Trump then cut that number in half, saying he was being ""kind.""

While Trump originally claimed the tariffs would reflect not just trade deficits but also non-monetary barriers and ""cheating,"" experts believe the administration used a quick, simple formula to push the policy through.

White House officials said the calculations came from the Council of Economic Advisers.

“The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price, and this is the saddest, bitterest thing of all. Carloads of oranges dumped on the ground. The people came for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges, and they are angry at the crime, angry at the people who have come to take the fruit. A million people hungry, needing the fruit- and kerosene sprayed over the golden mountains. And the smell of rot fills the country. Burn coffee for fuel in the ships. Burn corn to keep warm, it makes a hot fire. Dump potatoes in the rivers and place guards along the banks to keep the hungry people from fishing them out. Slaughter the pigs and bury them, and let the putrescence drip down into the earth.

“There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificate- died of malnutrition- because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.

ml4cutx,"I’m no economics major or anything, so I may be wrong in some parts. Essentially, it’s a tax levied on imported goods, and the percentage is dependent on what the imported product is and the country of origin.

Say Canada has a 30% tariff on American beef (idk if true or not, I made it up). Canada taxes Canadian importers of American beef that 30%. The importers (the companies importing these goods) either has to eat the cost by keeping prices the same and have a smaller profit margin as a result or bake that cost into the price of the product, thus consumers having to cover the cost of the tariff, which usually is the case. Canada may be applying tariffs onto some American goods because their industries are smaller and can’t produce as cheaply as the US can (also some industries might not be subsidized by the Canadian government as much as some US industries are being subsidized by the US government, hence American companies able to sell things and export things much cheaply), so they need to protect their own economy and industries by doing so.

So these tariffs Trump slapped onto all these different countries means that goods from all of these listed countries are going to cost more to import. It’s not the US charging these countries these tariffs, or as Trump puts it, it’s not the American government paying these tariffs to these countries. (In the example I gave above, it’s not the US government paying Canada 30% tariffs that they imposed on American beef.) It’s a tax slapped on by the federal government to American importers as a “revenue source” if you will, for the government. Essentially, everyday Americans are going to be paying these extra/higher taxes to the government on literally everything coming from these countries.

Investors ""all knew it was coming days in advance,"" so investors bought and sold according to this information *days ago*, meaning that stock prices were set according to this information days ago, meaning that changes in stock markets just before the policy changes were finally announced were changes *from those baseline beliefs*.

Think about it: if Trump says ""I'm going to crash the economy one week from now"" do you wait a week to dump your shares in, say, Apple? No, you dump them right away, so the stock price tanks right away. Someone else bought them though at that new, lower price, thinking that would still be worth it. If in six days some routine information comes out - say an earnings call by Apple - which indicates that the stock is doing better, maybe the person who bought those stocks sells for a higher price; the price and the index go up.

Then Trump crashes the economy and shit hits the fan but everyone who traded in Apple did so with knowledge of what was going on. I think sometimes there's a belief that when the stock price goes down due to people selling, those shares are no longer owned by investors, so they then won't be traded again until things calm down. Maybe because they feel, ""well in this situation, no-one would want to own Apple at all!""

ml3dbx6,"So twofold answer: 

1) tariffs can serve a purpose

2) selective mathematics


1 - The US is a behemoth of a trading partner. If a country, say Cambodia, want to ensure that they have, say, tractor companies to do business in Cambodia and support Cambodian farms, they're going to be competing with American tractors that had been established, advanced, and robust for decades (^(this tractor talk is purely hypothetical)). It would make sense for Cambodia to increase tariffs on Tractors in order to build them at home. Food, for better or worse, is a national security issue after all, and in the event the US or any country becomes hostile they would need internal capabilities to maintain their existence. The US, in the same scenario has no need to tariff Cambodian tractors--their tractor business is advanced and robust. It would make no sense to tariff cambodian tractors, they have no reason to. Another good example that is *real* is US dairy and Canadian tariffs on US dairy (only if a threshhold is exceeded). The US ***massively*** subsidizes dairy farms. Massively. US milk/cheese would massively outcompete Canadian dairy products in a completely free market putting 95% of Canadian dairy farmers out of business. Obviously thats a bad thing for Canada, see above national security. Likewise, the US doesnt need to tariff candian dairy, we already massively outcompete them and are at zero risk of losing marketshare.

2 - Now that Cambodia had set a 30% tariff on tractors, the US can say ""CAMBODIA IS TARIFFING US AT 30%!!!!"" While ignoring the fact that for the most part US goods arent tariffed (or tariffed that high). This administration has been caught multiple times cherrypicking statistics, and as far as Im aware they refuse to publish any actual report detailing how they came up with these figures.

""For those of us who lived through the Great Depression, the memory of the suffering it caused is deep and searing. And today many economic analysts and historians argue that high tariff legislation passed back in that period called the Smoot-Hawley tariff greatly deepened the depression and prevented economic recovery.

You see, at first, when someone says, \`\`Let's impose tariffs on foreign imports,'' it looks like they're doing the patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes for a short while it works -- but only for a short time. What eventually occurs is: First, homegrown industries start relying on government protection in the form of high tariffs. They stop competing and stop making the innovative management and technological changes they need to succeed in world markets. And then, while all this is going on, something even worse occurs. High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. The result is more and more tariffs, higher and higher trade barriers, and less and less competition. So, soon, because of the prices made artificially high by tariffs that subsidize inefficiency and poor management, people stop buying. Then the worst happens: Markets shrink and collapse; businesses and industries shut down; and millions of people lose their jobs.""

The only real fix is a replacement due to the vapor chamber being broken, and that not really being something that can be swapped out.  
  
The cheap fix would be to buy a new card.  If I were doing that it would be a 4090, and they cost as much or more than 5090's since they outperform most games currently (absent frame gen).

The PC itself is fine, and I've got my old card which is a 6950XT, with the two performing about the same due to all the 7900 heat throttling.

Washed up celebrity/actor turned businessman grifter

Popularized trickle down BS economics

Tax cuts and deregulation 

Enabled by a cult of personality to get away with pretty much anything

Abused his position as SAG president to enrich his cronies who in turn funded his political ambitions

Reagan was the oldest president at the time at just under 70 when elected and had serious dementia by his second term

Switched from democrat/liberal to conservative in order to win elections

His handling of the aids epidemic is similiar to trump and covid

I mean some of the ratfuckers working with trump like Roger Stone have been working with republican presidents since nixon, Richard Barr, Theil, etc. The biggest difference is the mask has come off but the same people & issues predate reagan. 

Reagan was at least charismatic enough it's easier to understand his popularity despite him overall being an objectively terrible president. But if you read up on his rise to president from actor & SAG president the parallels to trump are pretty clear.

>After Reagan was elected President of the United States in 1980, Melvyn Douglas said of his former friend that Reagan turned to the right after he had begun to believe the pro-business speeches he delivered for General Electric when he was the host of the ""G.E. Theater."")

>Wasserman at M.C.A. was one of the pioneers of television syndication, and this was to benefit Reagan enormously. M.C.A. was the only talent agency that was also allowed to be a producer through an exemption to union rules granted by S.A.G. when Reagan was the union president, and it used the exemption to acquire Universal International Pictures. 

>The ownership of Universal and its entry into the production of television shows that were syndicated to network made M.C.A. the most successful organization in Hollywood of its time, a real cash cow as television overtook the movies as the #1 business of the entertainment industry. Wasserman repaid Ronald Reagan's largess by structuring a deal by which he hosted and owned part of General Electric Theater (1953)\

>Wasserman and his partner, M.C.A. Chairman Jules Styne (a Republican), helped ensure that Reagan would be financially secure for the rest of his life so that he could enter politics. (At the time, he was the host of ""Death Valley Days"" on TV.)

>According to the Wall Street Journal, Universal sold Reagan a nice piece of land of many acres north of Santa Barbara that had been used for location shooting.

That’s a good starter, but don’t trust me — do your own googling!

Some tidbits:
US TAXES INCOME MORE
In the United States, taxes on just the income and profits of individuals (not businesses) generated 42 percent of total tax revenue, compared with 27 percent for all other OECD countries combined.

US TAXES CONSUMPTION LESS
The United States relies less on taxes on goods and services (including both general consumption taxes and selective sales taxes on specific goods and services) than any other OECD country, collecting 17 percent of tax revenue this way compared with 28 percent for the rest of the OECD. 

Taxing income more and consumption less —> more progressive than other tax systems

“So, what happens when you take into account all taxes paid? It turns out the U.S. federal tax system remains very progressive. Meaning, Americans with the highest incomes pay the largest share of all federal taxes.”

Myth 5: “Europe’s Higher Tax Revenues Derive from Aggressively Taxing the Rich”
American progressives often hold up Europe—especially the Scandinavian social democracies of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden—as successful tax-the-rich utopias that the U.S. should replicate. In reality, these European tax systems do not fit the American progressive image because their higher revenues are overwhelmingly raised through steep income, payroll, and consumption taxes on the middle class.

Finland, Norway, and Sweden do collect an average of 42.6% of GDP in taxes, versus 26.6% from America’s federal, state, and local governments. However, 14.5 of the 16-percentage-point overage comes from higher payroll taxes and value-added tax (VAT), which broadly hit the middle class. These nations’ individual income-tax revenues exceed those of the U.S. by just 0.8% of GDP, while their 3.5% of GDP advantage in corporate-tax revenues is overwhelmingly driven by Norway, with its massive oil and gas industry (by contrast, Finland and Sweden exceed the U.S. by 1% of GDP). These nations’ remaining taxes combined collect nearly 3% of GDP less than those in the U.S. (see Figure 4).[18

**A similar dynamic holds when comparing the U.S. with the other 37 OECD nations, which collect an average of 34.1% of GDP in tax revenues, compared with America’s 26.6%. Yet VAT revenues—which average 7.2% of GDP in OECD, versus none in America—account for nearly the entire difference. A total of 37 of the 38 OECD nations—all except the U.S.—impose VATs** at rates ranging from 5% (Canada) to 27% (Hungary). The Scandinavian nations of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden each have VAT rates of about 24%–25% that collect an average of 9.1% of GDP, or roughly one-fifth to one-quarter of their total tax revenues. VATs (and, to a lesser extent, payroll taxes)—which are not particularly progressive—drive the vast majority of Europe’s tax-revenue advantage over the United States. Mimicking Scandinavia’s 9.1% of GDP in VAT revenues would require American taxes of $2.4 trillion per year, or nearly $18,000 per household.[19]

**Moreover, top rates imposed on corporations and wealthy families in the U.S. often exceed OECD averages (see Figure 5). America’s top average income-tax bracket of 43.7% (including state) taxes slightly exceeds the OECD average of 42.6%. America’s highest tax brackets also exceed the OECD average for capital-gains taxes (29.2% vs. 19.1%), corporate income taxes (25.8% vs. 23.6%), and estate/inheritance taxes (40% vs. 30%). In fact, America’s corporate and estate/inheritance-tax rates well exceed those of all Scandinavian nations**",Gewdtymez,1,1743639822.0,htpstaxpolicycenterorgbriefingbokhowdoustaxescompareinternationaly good start trust I cool tidbit taxis income unite state taxis income profit individual business generate percent total tax revenue compare percent old country combine taxis consumption less unite state relief less taxis good service include general consumption taxis selective sale taxis specific good service old country collect percent tax revenue way compare percent rest old tax income consumption less progressive tax system htpstaxfoundationorgtaxeduprimersprimercomontaxmythsdebunke happen take account taxis pay turn federal tax system remain progressive mean americans high income pay large share federal taxis htpsmanhataninstitutearticlecorectingthetoptaxmyths myth europe higher tax revenue derive aggressive tax rich american progressive often hold europespecialy scandinavian social democracy denmark finland norway swede successful taxtherich utopian delicate reality european tax system fit american progressive image higher revenue overwhelmingly raise steep income patrol consumption taxis middle class finland norway sweden collect average gdp taxis versus american federal state local government however percentagepoint average come higher patrol taxis valueade tax vat broadly hit middle class nation individual incometax revenue exceed gdp gdp advantage corporatetax revenue overwhelmingly drive norway massive oil gas industry contrast finland sweden exceed gdp nation remain taxis combine collect nearly gdp less see figure similar dynamic hold compare old nation collect average gdp tax revenue compare american yet vat revenueswhich average gdp old versus none americacount nearly entire difference total old national except impose vast rate range canada hungary scandinavian nation denmark finland norway sweden vat rate collect average gdp roughly onefifth onequarter total tax revenue vast less extent patrol taxeswhich particularly progresivedrive vast majority europe taxrevenue advantage unite state mimic scandinavian gdp vat revenue would require american taxis trillion per year nearly per household moreover top rate impose corporation wealthy family often exceed old average see figure american top average incometax bracket include state taxis slightly exceed old average american high tax bracket also exceed old average capitalgain taxis vs corporate income taxis vs estateinheritance taxis vs fact american corporate estateinheritancetax rate well exceed scandinavian nation

ml9eejv,"How much money do you think rich people pay in taxes annually? At 50% including state taxes their net taxable revenue is around 1 trillion dollars. The deficit is over 2 trillion dollars and liabilities increase every year and are only expected to keep increasing. Also there is an inverse relationship with increasing taxes on wealthy people at certain point. 

Supply and demand is solvable with increases in supply and competition domestically. If prices increase you have more people who can enter the market and increase supply. There’s not a monopoly on beef there’s competition and the more of that we can foster the better prices are. 

We were in a fake position before the tariffs, I would say we were in stage 1 cancer with a path to stage 4 in the future. What do you think happens to 37 trillion dollar increasing faster than growth and interest rates climbing. It’s untenable

You can increase capital gains taxes for personal purchases, I agree with that. But you have to realize that most ultra wealthy people have money on paper and move it from one asset class to another which increases monetary availability in the market. If you increase capital gains on in kind asset transfers you limit the available capital in the market which stimies growth, which is essential for not going into a depression. Also the U.S. is the largest market for foreign capital, if you increase capital gains you make the U.S. less attractive to outside money. Which is a massive problem because that would further exacerbate the lack of monetary availability in the market.

If this was 1970 I would agree. But with the emergence of major economies around the world and major growth markets the U.S. no longer as a monopoly on stable investments.

We don't have high unemployment, and factory jobs aren't required to have a strong economy.  The US economy has adapted to be heavily service based and its been booming.  

>What tariffs in this case do is provide incentive for manufacturers to come here to make their stuff which is bad for the economy right?

Except it's not doing this at all, because the cost of creating manufacturing infrastructure and producing goods here is too high. 

It would take colossal investment very very few companies can afford, most of a decade to get rolling, and then they'd still be producing goods at such a high expense per unit, plus having to pay for all that infrastructure investment, that everything they produce would be too expensive for americans to afford.

A company that makes combs that sell for $5 isn't going to spend $120 million building a factory in the US to make the same comb and sell it for $14.  They wouldn't be competitive.

ml9mrxd,"No that is not how that works. They have to pay the interest on the loans which are usually between 4-7% and they have to sell the assets to cover that percentage. Banks don’t loan you money if they don’t get paid, it’s called an asset backed loan….anyone can get one. It just allows you to keep your stocks that grow faster than the interest rate. They have to pay taxes on the stocks they sold to pay the interest rate. 

Like I said this is going to take time.

Almost all consumer goods are considered non essential which means that there prices can only increase to certain thresholds before people stop buying them. If you think tariffs help rich people you clearly aren’t paying attention to the markets, this is going to severely dampen rich people’s only source of income (stocks increasing)

Tax cuts to the rich will not even come close to offsetting how much money they are going to be losing on stocks not increasing at prior rates. 

I think this whole thing stems from the fact that people who don’t have money don’t understand the concept that the more money you have the less money you actually spend and wealth accumulation is not “earned income”. Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t earned income in years they just don’t sell their Facebook stock and that increases in value. When people say Rich people make a lot of money it’s overly simplifying what’s actually happening. If I buy apple at 50$ and its goes to 150$ I’ve tripled my assets value but you don’t actually make any money until you sell the asset. Taxing unrealized gains would be the single dumbest thing that you could possibly do, which is why not a single country on the entire planet does that.

Also there is a massive difference between a monopoly and five business that hate each other and are constantly trying to out compete and sell more products than the other.
