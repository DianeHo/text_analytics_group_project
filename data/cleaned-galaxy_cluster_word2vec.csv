The displays are awful if you ask me, not being as bright as the competition. And both my S24 and S24U had the famous grain/sandpaper screen, where under about 30% brightness pixels weren't being lit evenly and grain appears on dark areas.

The P9P I have no issues with whatsoever, yet. I am not a gamer on my phone, so its lesser SoC doesn't matter to me. Battery life has been amazing. And dare I say, better than on my S24U. And it even feels snappier (as long as you don't require a gaming phone or need to use all CPU cores at once to say render something). I haven't even felt it getting warm with my usage, which is mainly YouTube, streaming, socials, photography, work related apps and lots of browsing.
