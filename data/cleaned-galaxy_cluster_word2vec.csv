So they will continue drop to the market wet and uncompleted products with marketing tricks.

- 60 Hz display ... for 800$...in 2025 year? Really? 
- or, for 1400 $ Apple AI ... which doesn't work in the half of the world for now ... And where it works: still the same Siri, which for now is only able to ask ChatGPT ))

6000ma battery
120w fast charging 
4500nits

10bit LOG raw video

If you are, you are seriously deluded and are just justifying whatever Samsung gives.. Samsung could take away all the cameras and put in a 10mp camera and you will still try your best to defend them

Samsung has used the SAME camera sensor since the s21 ultra  Let this sink in your head or are you in denial 


""it's m13 plus, not m13""  Doesn't matter how you slice it or go around the bushes with it.. IT IS STILL THE OLDER M13. It isn't the NEWER M14 panel. Samsung are giving you older specs not new ones

The displays are awful if you ask me, not being as bright as the competition. And both my S24 and S24U had the famous grain/sandpaper screen, where under about 30% brightness pixels weren't being lit evenly and grain appears on dark areas.

The P9P I have no issues with whatsoever, yet. I am not a gamer on my phone, so its lesser SoC doesn't matter to me. Battery life has been amazing. And dare I say, better than on my S24U. And it even feels snappier (as long as you don't require a gaming phone or need to use all CPU cores at once to say render something). I haven't even felt it getting warm with my usage, which is mainly YouTube, streaming, socials, photography, work related apps and lots of browsing. Gemini is leading, with AI being stamped on everything these days. The camera is way better than I had hoped coming from Samsung and expecting them to have been closer to the competition in photography.
