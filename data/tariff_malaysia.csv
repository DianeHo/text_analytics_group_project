Trade Deficit: 22.1B

Imports: 47.7B

“Tariff charged to USA”: 22.1/47.7=46%

> But with Trump imposing tariffs on US trading partners, there is now zero reason to keep [IP and anti-circumvention] laws on the books around the world, and every reason to get rid of them. Every country could have the kind of disruptors who start a business with just a little capital, aimed directly at the highest margins of these stupidly profitable, S&P500-leading US tech giants, treating those margins as opportunities. They could jailbreak HP printers so they take any ink-cartridge; jailbreak iPhones so they can run any app store; jailbreak tractors so farmers can fix them without paying rent to Deere; jailbreak every make and model of every car so that any mechanic can diagnose and fix it, with compatible parts from any manufacturer. These aren't just nice things to do for the people in your country's borders: they are businesses, massive investment opportunities. The first country that perfects the universal car diagnosing tool will sell one to every mechanic in the world – along with subscriptions that keep up with new cars and new manufacturer software updates. That country could have the relationship to car repairs that Finland had to mobile phones for a decade, when Nokia disrupted the markets of every landline carrier in the world:

Trump administration thinks that will drive consumers to buy locally and that will reduce imports from Malaysia - we as a country profit less from the US. 

Obviously, the smart thing to do is go look for trade deals elsewhere. But that comes with its own risk. Doing business with US is historically good because of its stability and financial strength, it also helps that US have no territorial interests in our region.

It's all because of that stupid TV show The Apprentice, quite a lot of Malaysians are fans of that TV show even though they should know better it's all scripted.

About 4 months back, there were still some Malaysian redditors that insulted me, because I said Trump will just kill the economy...that was somewhere around when he got elected for the 2nd time.

Oh wait, a lot of them are on Youtube too, on Malaysian news channels. These Malaysian Trumpists are worshiping the DOGE team and still think (as of a few days ago) firing federal workers as a good thing (they also said they wanted the same dismantling in Malaysia...). Also whoever is managing those channels, love to delete my criticism about Trump especially the STAR. Can't even talk about their beloved god, Elon Musk.

Well it was the worst back in Trump's 1st term, my gosh so many Malaysians who should know better... Man, when 6th Jan coup happened, so many Malaysians were still making excuses for Trump. I read all the hundreds of pages of court records and investigations that were freely published by the DOJ, pointed out about all the weird points and Trump's fake nonsense about the 2020 election.   
And still some Malaysians believe in Trump...  
They were not all right wing, some were just star struck, or an unhealthy obsession about being white despite obviously being POC (reverse racism is a thing), some made excuses like because he's rich, or he's not Muslim or he's a Christian (Trump can't recite a single verse from Bible, also he literally gassed a church with military weapons).

That also makes sense, because it's cheaper to pay a Malaysian laborer than a US one. 

In contrast, a lot of Malaysian, B50, don't make that much money. How can they buy loads of US produced goods? They are all so expensive, especially after currency conversion. So it's no surprise Malaysia buys very few things from the US. This results in the trade deficit (from the US side) with Malaysia.

The US saw the trade deficit with Malaysia, and probably decided it needs to be corrected since Trump hate's trade deficits. 

Argentina for example was one of the countries hit with 10% tariffs. Why? Probably because the US has a trade surplus with Argentina. US exported 9 billion to Argentina, while importing 7 billion. So the US actually has a trade surplus with Argentina and is ""winning"" the trade war, so no need to put more than 10% additional tariff. https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/argentina/",Array_626,14,1743635847.0

Edit: a reply from r/indonesia

Simply put, Trump believes trade deficit = tariff to the US.

The US imports $148.2 bil from Japan, and exports $79.7 bil to Japan. That's a deficit of -46%. So Japan gets a 23% (ish) tariff.

The US imports $63.4 bil from Switzerland, and exports $25.0 bil to Switzerland. That's a deficit of -61%. So Switzerland gets a 31% tariff.

SOURCES: https://ustr.gov/countries-regions

Here comes the stupid part! If a country has a trade deficit it does not mean a weak economy. In contrast, it signifies strong consumer demand hence increased import. Without contextual analysis for each country, Trump straight up label trade deficit as ""tariff imposed"" which is inherently wrong. Not only did Trump did a global-scale misinformation by masking deficit as tarif, it painted a picture that most countries in the world takes advantage of US, which is not true.

But the Malaysian company selling this product is selling for $100 - they do not charge $124 dollars because they are not paying any taxes. So the price increase comes from the US company not being happy with the import tax, and so they pass the cost to the customer. So for example instead of selling the product for $110 to make a profit of $10 they instead sell for $134 to make the same profit. 

We as Malaysians will not be paying any taxes to the US it will be their locals are affected.

Trumps 1st term tariffs didn’t increase jobs.  Prices will inevitably go up in the US and that means the inflation rate and interest rates will follow.  The dollar will drop.  Everyone is already boycotting US products.  In 4 years America will be a wasteland.

So how can this policy make sense for the US - if, and only if, the targeted countries give in.  We can drop import duties on US cars at the risk of job loss in perodua.  We can allow import of their awful, unhygienic, non-halal food at the risk of riots.

Her 388 page report (https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20250310143933/https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)  
Can be summarized as ""there is no good evidence in gender affirming care, in fact Cass literally wrote that there is no need for paediatric care for trans children and even accuse that trans children are brainwashed to becomes trans"" (which more than 60+ mental health organizations deny this). The Times and Hillary Cass said that Alejandro Carrobello has no right to write her criticism when that is anything but FASCISM. Well it seems we found the fascist here and it's YOU! Congratulations, you're far more closer to Trump despite your denials! \*Clap Clap\* Aren't you so proud of yourself.  


Never mind that you accused me of having non-reliable resources, when you entirely depended on social media posts made by other people, it's so amazing how you don't see the hypocrisy dripping from yourself. And now it's revealed you depended on defunding scientific articles as ""evidence"".

If anyone wants to read over the neuroscience of trans brains, the explanation is:  
Trans women will have similar brains to women like decreased connectivity in the superior parietal regions or trans men similar to men, will have weaker connectivity between intra-salience regions and executive control networks) so obviously the human genome is more complex and our notion of what gender is, is a man made construct.  
AKA trans people are not being brainwashed but rather their brains are giving signals them that their bodies are in an unnatural state. Causes can be due to the S0X9 gene that if this gets disrupted the testis doesn't get developed or barely developed at all even though it's there (during fetal development).

There's also Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) which is the body unable to use androgen, hyperandrogenism is excessive levels of androgen, and various other conditions that often deter intersex athletes from competing. Which sports rules are often not scientific (like in ice skating grown adult women are forced to compete with 13 year olds, which the Triple Axle depends on how little weight the body is and extremely taxing for adult women leading to permanent injuries).

Even hetero men and lesbian women brains have asymmetry brains similar to each other, while hetero women and gay men do not have that symmetry, literally unable to respond to hormones of the orientation they don't desire (in fact numerous reactions of vomiting and disgust are observed). Showed in scans of the anterior hypothalamus.

Cass accuses the studies as being low grade, but based on what expertise when she has none of the qualifications to even scrutinize thousands of gender affirming care? (really sounds like a carbon copy of Trump) Heck she doesn't even know there is no 2 tier grade system for these studies but multiples. Which some among them would be mammograms but you don't see anyone trying ban mammograms.

Well, that should be enough already. As everyone can see, you don't have any logic, nor any evidence, you relied on articles saying that Alejandra Carrebello should be silenced and the worst of all you seriously thought Hillary Cass's study based on beliefs was anywhere near scientific. I spent more than enough time for your drivel that was under the guise about accuracy when it was more about invalidating trans activists.",DarkAgeha,1,1743683902.0

ml6zuhn,">Oh I forgot about the Times article that requires you to PAY UP. How very sneaky of you requiring me to pay what is likely to be lies. (Gatekeeping too)

Look dude, I literally just used archive.ph to read the contents. I'm shocked I have to even tell you to do this. It's absolutely wild that I've had to spoonfeed you through every step of looking for information. It's even wilder that at every step of the way as I offered alternatives to provide you that information, you not only declined, but doubled down on calling me a liar - when you could easily click on my profile, scroll down and voila, the original comment with links provided. And now, apparently I have something against trans activists? Lol.

>I cannot say her methods of not a single scrutiny to deter bias but rather facilitate bias, has any merit. Why shouldn't Hillary Cass be scrutinized and criticized for trying to demerit the thousands of trans studies? And yet here you are being a HYPOCRITE while accusing Alejandra Carabello of using CHATGPT when she is obviously against any form of AI when her specialty is CYBERLAW. Which I noticed you just simply ignored that because the facts don't agree with what you have already decided in your bias mind.

She should be scrutinized, as everyone in science is - accuracy matters. The point is Caraballo, in her guise as a citizen journalist is sidestepping the nuances of the matter to go ""trans oppression"" and fuel even more panic in what is already an incredibly stressful time for trans people. On top of the ChatGPT usage, she's eating her own community. That is why I say there are better sources out there to link where they at least have to follow basic journalistic ethics - something Caraballo, who is not a trained journalist, isn't. The relevant quote:

>In a post on Twitter/X, Caraballo accused Cass and the review team of holding trans healthcare to an “impossible standard”. This was because, she said, transgender patients could not take hormones “blind”, as the effects of any hormones would fairly quickly become obvious.

>Her tweets were contradicted by the publication of the Cass review hours later.
During a systematic review, researchers looking at studies on transgender healthcare found no blind control ones — so used another system altogether to determine study quality. Cass told The Times last week how difficult it would be to use blind control studies in relation to trans patients, for the same reasons identified by Caraballo.

>As for Caraballo’s claim that the review team “disregarded nearly all studies”, Cass pointed out that 60 out of 103 studies reviewed were used for the conclusions. They were studies deemed to be of moderate and high quality on the effects of puberty blockers and hormone treatment.

More than half of the studies being used is not some erasure of the scientific method. It is simply how science works. Caraballo was also accusing the review team of using X method, when the method was Z. That is a lack of journalistic ethics. Furthermore, this personal attack is not becoming of a journalist:

>In response to Cass’s interview with the Times last week — in which she revealed she had been told to stay off public transport — Caraballo claimed the physician was making herself a victim.

>She shared online: “Trans teens have been viciously attacked and murdered in the UK and Hilary Cass wants to make herself the victim here after taking away their healthcare.”

Like you, Caraballo is jumping to conclusions with people who disagree. I will also point out this had *political ramifications*:

>Other false theories, spread in the wake of the review’s publication by figures including Labour MP Dawn Butler, claimed that 100 studies had been rejected from the report. Butler told the House of Commons: “There are around 100 studies that have not been included in this Cass report and we need to know why.”

>When confronted by Cass’s assertions in The Times — that more than 60 studies were included in the review — Butler refused to concede she was wrong.

>She said: “Organisations, such as Stonewall, have raised serious concerns about how research was selected and what the criteria for inclusion and exclusion were. This includes concerns about the way evidence was ‘graded’, and why around 100 studies have not been included.”
On Monday night, Butler corrected the record in the House of Commons over her statement on the Cass review — blaming LGBT lobbying group Stonewall for her mistake.

So not only was misinformation spread, Alejandra Caraballo contributed directly to scapegoating of a queer organization, further drawing pressure on them. Is that good activism? You can criticize things, but there must be a basis instead of falsehoods which lead to conspiracy theories and widespread panic. In an age where foreign powers are using the media to spread lies, *we* have to be on guard. We have to push back, not act like Caraballo did. 

I will be ending this here and blocking you because frankly, interacting with you has left a bad taste. Not only did you immediately go on the defensive and attempt to slander me, you have attempted to shadowbox with me as some kind of menacing transphobic Trumpist enemy? At any point, you could have looked in my profile and realized this (indeed, this is common Reddit knowledge, look in a profile to figure someone out). You could have asked if it was possibly an issue with either of us using Old Reddit or Shreddit - something you don't seem to know about. You could have reached out to the mods to figure out if Reddit filters links, or even searched on other subreddits. Instead, at every point you have been trying to smear me. 

You are a good case study in bad faith in the guise of leftism, and as a fellow leftist I am honestly left shaking my head at how silly both of us have come across - myself in trying to have a conversation with someone looking to punch others, and yourself in your seeming hysterics. I'll leave this response for any onlookers, and they can decide if I was acting in bad faith or not. Perhaps I could have voiced this message better.
