> But with Trump imposing tariffs on US trading partners, there is now zero reason to keep [IP and anti-circumvention] laws on the books around the world, and every reason to get rid of them. Every country could have the kind of disruptors who start a business with just a little capital, aimed directly at the highest margins of these stupidly profitable, S&P500-leading US tech giants, treating those margins as opportunities. They could jailbreak HP printers so they take any ink-cartridge; jailbreak iPhones so they can run any app store; jailbreak tractors so farmers can fix them without paying rent to Deere; jailbreak every make and model of every car so that any mechanic can diagnose and fix it, with compatible parts from any manufacturer. These aren't just nice things to do for the people in your country's borders: they are businesses, massive investment opportunities. The first country that perfects the universal car diagnosing tool will sell one to every mechanic in the world – along with subscriptions that keep up with new cars and new manufacturer software updates. That country could have the relationship to car repairs that Finland had to mobile phones for a decade, when Nokia disrupted the markets of every landline carrier in the world:

ml3zyb5,"The US has a trade deficit with Malaysia. The US sold (exported) 24 billion worth of goods to Malaysia. The US bought (import) 52 billion worth of goods from Malaysia. https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/malaysia#:~:text=Malaysia%20Trade%20Summary&text=U.S.%20goods%20imports%20from%20Malaysia,(%242.1%20billion)%20over%202023. This means the US has a trade deficit of 20+ billion.

This makes sense. Malaysia is mainly a natural resource exporting nation, the biggest ones are probably palm oil and rubber. The US and other more developed nations buy these from us and then refine them into better goods that sell for more. I think Malaysia also does a bit of technology manufacturing, I've seen some hard drives in the US/Canada that were manufactured in Malaysia. That also makes sense, because it's cheaper to pay a Malaysian laborer than a US one. 

In contrast, a lot of Malaysian, B50, don't make that much money. How can they buy loads of US produced goods? They are all so expensive, especially after currency conversion. So it's no surprise Malaysia buys very few things from the US. This results in the trade deficit (from the US side) with Malaysia.

The US saw the trade deficit with Malaysia, and probably decided it needs to be corrected since Trump hate's trade deficits. 

Argentina for example was one of the countries hit with 10% tariffs. Why? Probably because the US has a trade surplus with Argentina. US exported 9 billion to Argentina, while importing 7 billion. So the US actually has a trade surplus with Argentina and is ""winning"" the trade war, so no need to put more than 10% additional tariff. https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/americas/argentina/",Array_626,14,1743635847.0,trade deficit malasha sell export billion worth good malasha buy import billion worth good malasha htpsustrgovcountriesregionsoutheastasiapacificmalaysiatextmalaysiatradesumarytextusgodsimportsfromalaysiabilionover mean trade deficit billion make sense malasha mainly natural resource export nation big one probably palm oil rubber develop nation buy refine well good sell I think malasha also bit technology manufacture I see hard drive canada manufacture malasha also make sense cheap pay malaysian laborer one contrast lot malaysian b make much money buy load produce good expensive especially currency conversion surprise malasha busy thing result trade deficit side malasha see trade deficit malasha probably decide need correct since tramp rate trade deficit argentina example one country hit tariff probably trade surplus argentina export billion argentina import billion actually trade surplus argentina win trade war need put additional tariff htpsustrgovcountriesregionsamericasargentina

Edit: a reply from r/indonesia

Simply put, Trump believes trade deficit = tariff to the US.

The US imports $148.2 bil from Japan, and exports $79.7 bil to Japan. That's a deficit of -46%. So Japan gets a 23% (ish) tariff.

The US imports $63.4 bil from Switzerland, and exports $25.0 bil to Switzerland. That's a deficit of -61%. So Switzerland gets a 31% tariff.

SOURCES: https://ustr.gov/countries-regions

Here comes the stupid part! If a country has a trade deficit it does not mean a weak economy. In contrast, it signifies strong consumer demand hence increased import. Without contextual analysis for each country, Trump straight up label trade deficit as ""tariff imposed"" which is inherently wrong. Not only did Trump did a global-scale misinformation by masking deficit as tarif, it painted a picture that most countries in the world takes advantage of US, which is not true.

But the Malaysian company selling this product is selling for $100 - they do not charge $124 dollars because they are not paying any taxes. So the price increase comes from the US company not being happy with the import tax, and so they pass the cost to the customer. So for example instead of selling the product for $110 to make a profit of $10 they instead sell for $134 to make the same profit. 

We as Malaysians will not be paying any taxes to the US it will be their locals are affected.

I already said - do nothing and wait for the US to burn or Trump to change his mind.

BTW - forget about Malaysia.  Will the tariffs work for the US?   The answer is no, on every level they will be bad.   Steel tariffs imposed in 2003 caused a loss of 168K US jobs.  Trumps 1st term tariffs didn’t increase jobs.  Prices will inevitably go up in the US and that means the inflation rate and interest rates will follow.  The dollar will drop.  Everyone is already boycotting US products.  In 4 years America will be a wasteland.

So how can this policy make sense for the US - if, and only if, the targeted countries give in.  We can drop import duties on US cars at the risk of job loss in perodua.  We can allow import of their awful, unhygienic, non-halal food at the risk of riots.

And yes ""Alejandra Caraballo ChatGPT"" was the 1st thing I tried many posts ago, which there is nothing about the so-called original post on the search pages. I even tried ""Alejandra Caraballo ChatGPT Bluesky"" which is how I found an AI comment about Alejandra Caraballo but it was on Twitter and no longer able to be viewed (even tried the Wayback Machine).  
Strangely none of the posts (there were only 2 people and yet you make it seem like this is among more people) criticizing Alejandra Caraballo, none could link to Alejandro Carabello's post but instead various versions of the so-called screenshot of the Carabello's post. And that's another clue that something is very suspicious when nothing is common.

Hilary Cass while is a paediatrician has no specialty in trans medical procedures nor about hormone therapy, nor about the neuroscience of trans brains but she has the gall to deny all those studies (of several decades worth at this point) in favor of her own beliefs.

I cannot say her methods of not a single scrutiny to deter bias but rather facilitate bias, has any merit. Why shouldn't Hillary Cass be scrutinized and criticized for trying to demerit the thousands of trans studies? And yet here you are being a HYPOCRITE while accusing Alejandra Carabello of using CHATGPT when she is obviously against any form of AI when her specialty is CYBERLAW. Which I noticed you just simply ignored that because the facts don't agree with what you have already decided in your bias mind.

Anyway back to Hillary Cass,   
Her 388 page report (https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ukgwa/20250310143933/https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/)  
Can be summarized as ""there is no good evidence in gender affirming care, in fact Cass literally wrote that there is no need for paediatric care for trans children and even accuse that trans children are brainwashed to becomes trans"" (which more than 60+ mental health organizations deny this). The Times and Hillary Cass said that Alejandro Carrobello has no right to write her criticism when that is anything but FASCISM. Well it seems we found the fascist here and it's YOU! Congratulations, you're far more closer to Trump despite your denials! \*Clap Clap\* Aren't you so proud of yourself.  


Never mind that you accused me of having non-reliable resources, when you entirely depended on social media posts made by other people, it's so amazing how you don't see the hypocrisy dripping from yourself. And now it's revealed you depended on defunding scientific articles as ""evidence"".

If anyone wants to read over the neuroscience of trans brains, the explanation is:  
Trans women will have similar brains to women like decreased connectivity in the superior parietal regions or trans men similar to men, will have weaker connectivity between intra-salience regions and executive control networks) so obviously the human genome is more complex and our notion of what gender is, is a man made construct.  
AKA trans people are not being brainwashed but rather their brains are giving signals them that their bodies are in an unnatural state. Causes can be due to the S0X9 gene that if this gets disrupted the testis doesn't get developed or barely developed at all even though it's there (during fetal development).

There's also Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) which is the body unable to use androgen, hyperandrogenism is excessive levels of androgen, and various other conditions that often deter intersex athletes from competing. Which sports rules are often not scientific (like in ice skating grown adult women are forced to compete with 13 year olds, which the Triple Axle depends on how little weight the body is and extremely taxing for adult women leading to permanent injuries).

Even hetero men and lesbian women brains have asymmetry brains similar to each other, while hetero women and gay men do not have that symmetry, literally unable to respond to hormones of the orientation they don't desire (in fact numerous reactions of vomiting and disgust are observed). Showed in scans of the anterior hypothalamus.

Cass accuses the studies as being low grade, but based on what expertise when she has none of the qualifications to even scrutinize thousands of gender affirming care? (really sounds like a carbon copy of Trump) Heck she doesn't even know there is no 2 tier grade system for these studies but multiples. Which some among them would be mammograms but you don't see anyone trying ban mammograms.

Which I noticed you just simply ignored that because the facts don't agree with what you have already decided in your bias mind.

She should be scrutinized, as everyone in science is - accuracy matters. The point is Caraballo, in her guise as a citizen journalist is sidestepping the nuances of the matter to go ""trans oppression"" and fuel even more panic in what is already an incredibly stressful time for trans people. On top of the ChatGPT usage, she's eating her own community. That is why I say there are better sources out there to link where they at least have to follow basic journalistic ethics - something Caraballo, who is not a trained journalist, isn't. The relevant quote:

>In a post on Twitter/X, Caraballo accused Cass and the review team of holding trans healthcare to an “impossible standard”. This was because, she said, transgender patients could not take hormones “blind”, as the effects of any hormones would fairly quickly become obvious.

>Her tweets were contradicted by the publication of the Cass review hours later.
During a systematic review, researchers looking at studies on transgender healthcare found no blind control ones — so used another system altogether to determine study quality. Cass told The Times last week how difficult it would be to use blind control studies in relation to trans patients, for the same reasons identified by Caraballo.

>As for Caraballo’s claim that the review team “disregarded nearly all studies”, Cass pointed out that 60 out of 103 studies reviewed were used for the conclusions. They were studies deemed to be of moderate and high quality on the effects of puberty blockers and hormone treatment.

More than half of the studies being used is not some erasure of the scientific method. It is simply how science works. Caraballo was also accusing the review team of using X method, when the method was Z. That is a lack of journalistic ethics. Furthermore, this personal attack is not becoming of a journalist:

>In response to Cass’s interview with the Times last week — in which she revealed she had been told to stay off public transport — Caraballo claimed the physician was making herself a victim.

>She shared online: “Trans teens have been viciously attacked and murdered in the UK and Hilary Cass wants to make herself the victim here after taking away their healthcare.”

Like you, Caraballo is jumping to conclusions with people who disagree. I will also point out this had *political ramifications*:

>Other false theories, spread in the wake of the review’s publication by figures including Labour MP Dawn Butler, claimed that 100 studies had been rejected from the report. Butler told the House of Commons: “There are around 100 studies that have not been included in this Cass report and we need to know why.”

>When confronted by Cass’s assertions in The Times — that more than 60 studies were included in the review — Butler refused to concede she was wrong.

>She said: “Organisations, such as Stonewall, have raised serious concerns about how research was selected and what the criteria for inclusion and exclusion were. This includes concerns about the way evidence was ‘graded’, and why around 100 studies have not been included.”
On Monday night, Butler corrected the record in the House of Commons over her statement on the Cass review — blaming LGBT lobbying group Stonewall for her mistake.

So not only was misinformation spread, Alejandra Caraballo contributed directly to scapegoating of a queer organization, further drawing pressure on them. Is that good activism? You can criticize things, but there must be a basis instead of falsehoods which lead to conspiracy theories and widespread panic. In an age where foreign powers are using the media to spread lies, *we* have to be on guard. We have to push back, not act like Caraballo did.

Not only did you immediately go on the defensive and attempt to slander me, you have attempted to shadowbox with me as some kind of menacing transphobic Trumpist enemy?
