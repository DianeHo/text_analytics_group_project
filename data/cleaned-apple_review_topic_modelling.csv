6,6,7,97.31,"phone, feature, apple, pro, even, still, need, one, look, like, know, battery, go, difference, care, people, give, would, year, get","> Today, select media outlets and YouTubers shared their first impressions of the iPhone 16 and ‌iPhone‌ 16 Plus, highlighting many of the incremental and notable updates.

> The key new features include the A18 chip, which provides enhanced performance and supports Apple Intelligence, faster charging, the Action Button, an enhanced ultra wide camera with support for macro photography, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 retains a similar design to the iPhone 15. The color palette has become more vibrant, with options like Ultramarine, Pink, and Teal. The camera arrangement has also been redesigned, moving from the previous diagonal layout to a vertical stack, a change that helps enable Spatial Video and Photo capture for the Vision Pro headset.

> Among the standout additions to the ‌iPhone‌ 16 is the introduction of the Action Button and the Camera Control. Previously exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the Action Button is a customizable button that replaces the traditional mute switch, offering users flexibility to assign various functions such as starting voice memos or launching shortcuts. Meanwhile, the new Camera Control capacitive button, located on the right side of the device, takes smartphone photography to the next level by mimicking a physical shutter button. It also integrates gestures for adjusting settings like zoom, exposure, and more.

> One of the ‌iPhone‌ 16's key features is support for Apple Intelligence. While many of these features are still on the way with future software updates, the A18 chip underpins the phone's ability to handle the AI tools, offering improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and overall user experience.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 brings several key camera upgrades, including an improved ultra wide camera, with support for macro photography for the first time on a standard ‌iPhone‌ model. Apple has also revamped its Photographic Styles, improving how the camera handles skin tones, shadows, and highlights in real-time.",today select medium outlet youtuber share first impression phone phone plus highlight many incremental notable update key new feature include chip provide enhance performance support apple intelligence fast charge action button enhance ultra wide camera support micro photography reap photographic style anew camera control button phone retain similar design phone color palate become vagrant option like ultramarine pink tell camera arrangement also design move previous diagonal layout vertical stick change help enable spatial video photo capture vision pro head among standout addition phone introduction action button camera control previously exclusive phone pro action button customizable button replace traditional mute switch offering user flexibility assign various function start voice mean launch shortcut meanwhile new camera control capacity button locate right side device take smartphone photography next level mimic physical shutter button also integrate gesture adjust setting like room exposure one phone key feature support apple intelligence many feature still way future software update chip undermine phone ability handle ai tool offering improvement performance battery efficiency overall user experience phone bring several key camera upgrade include improve ultra wide camera support micro photography first time standard phone model apple also reap photographic style improve camera candle skin tone shadow highlight realize

Point being, these are $500 dollar phones. In the Android world 120hz is pretty standard now. About every phone has it. Or some have at minimum 90hz.

Nail on the head and the comment below also hits it home. 

If you’ve had it you are probably not going to want to come back from it but the average user doesn’t care and won’t care either until they use it.

I agree with the cost of the phones it should be a standard given what comes with much cheaper phones - however the only way to get Apple to change that is with your wallet and not buying those devices.

But as they continue to sell it’s apparent the majority just don’t care to be fair.
