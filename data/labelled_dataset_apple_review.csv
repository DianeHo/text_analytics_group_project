37,175,lnvhv7u,"I agree with what you‚Äôve said - but 120hz is not the same as ‚Äú1000 songs in your pocket‚Äù or ‚Äúan iPod, a phone, an internet communicator‚Äù.

It‚Äôs a smoother, more responsive screen, on top of one of the best smartphones on the market. 120hz is great. I think every phone should have it. I‚Äôm not ‚Äúmaking excuses‚Äù. I‚Äôm just telling you that for a fact, many people can not tell the difference.

5,233,lnxeuar,What do you mean by something else? They already have a lot of stuff on the base models that is slightly worse in some way. Battery life. Display brightness. Cameras. Materials.

Yes there‚Äôs a difference. Yes people like us can tell the difference and appreciate it. But the average iPhone user doesn‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs like that motion-smoothing feature on your parents tv that they just left on, even though it looks awful. They don‚Äôt know the difference, or it‚Äôs of minimal importance to them even if you showed them the difference.

The reality is that if you‚Äôre on the Apple subreddit, you‚Äôre probably who the ‚ÄúPro‚Äù is aimed at.",sheeplectric,-6,1726724695,yes difference yes people like tell difference appreciate average phone user care like motionsmothe feature parent leave even though look awful know difference minimal importance even show difference reality apple subredit probably pro aim,10,negative
