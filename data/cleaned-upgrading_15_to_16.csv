lmi2iug,"There are hidden benefits to getting the 16 Pro over the 15 Pro such as support for WiFi 7, the modem in the 16 Pro uses the Snapdragon X75 vs the X70 in the 15 Pro which this modem allows the phone to use the 5G Advanced standard which gives better 5G speeds by optimizing how the network handles large data transfers and improving efficiency of the spectrum usage. It also provides lower latency and has better network management so if say you’re at a large music festival then your device will be able to handle the traffic to the towers and perform still. Lastly it allows for better range to use mmWave speeds. 

The 15 Pro can’t do the same network things the 16 Pro will be able to fully do so the 16 Pro is a good future proof option that would allow you to then skip the 17 etc. plus with Qi2 charging and 25W wireless charging that’s a decent upgrade. Then the A18 Pro chip will handle AI tasks better also for years to come while still being a powerhouse. It’s really a lot of under the hood things about the 16 Pro that could honestly warrant an upgrade. Not sure I’d do but if I did I’d only go through the iPhone Upgrade program so if you wanted to get a new device after 12 months you can and it’s still unlocked plus the price comes with AppleCare+",zouinenoah29,26,1726002570.0,hide benefit get pro pro support wife mode pro use snapdragon x vs x pro mode allow phone use g advance standard give well g speed optimize network candle large datum transfer improve efficiency spectrum usage also provide lower lately well network management say large music festival device able handle traffic tower perform still lastly allow well range use wave speed pro network thing pro able fully pro good future proof option would allow skin etc plus I charge w tireless charge decent upgrade pro chip handle ai task well also year come still poorhouse really lot hood thing pro could honestly warrant upgrade sure I I I go phone upgrade program want get new device month still unlocked plus price come aplecare

lmizsap,"Yep. I’m on the iPhone Upgrade Program so I basically pay for half an iPhone per year. I also tried out the Max this year and it’s just too big, IMO. New one is getting even bigger, so I’m looking forward to this new slightly larger regular Pro. I think that one will be perfect for me.

If the program didn’t exist, at a minimum I’d buy an iPhone every other year, so this works out to be about the same. No way I could go every three years, which is the next longest option. It’s also nice to not have to pamper the battery and worry about replacing it.

Sure, I could go every other year and then I’d own the phone outright and it would be paid off right when the newest one came out so it would be two generations behind and that would drop the price down more, but then I would have to mess around with selling it and dealing with scammers on EBay or shady trade-in sites. Before the iPhone Upgrade Program, I had been there, I had done that. I just like how easy this is and I’m willing to pay extra for the convenience of always having a new reliable phone with the latest tech sent with a return shipping box ready to go.

It’s strange to me that Apple doesn’t do this with any other products. Maybe because people are less likely to frequently update them? Or perhaps because Apple can’t commit to regular updates for their other products? If they offered this for the Mac, I would definitely do it, as long as the period was two years to upgrade, four years to pay off. Same for iPad and Apple Watch. Most of them I would probably just pay off since I keep them longer and then hand down to family, but it would be nice to upgrade if some cool new thing arrives that I really want, like a jet black titanium OLED MacBook Pro with 5G and Face ID with tiny bezels that allows for a 15” display in roughly the current 14” size.",mac_duke,2,1726014321.0,yep phone upgrade program I basically pay half phone per year I also try max year big mio new one get even big look forward new slightly large regular pro I think one perfect I program exist minimum I buy phone every year work way I could go every three year next long option also nice paper battery worry replace sure I could go every year I phone outright would pay right new one come would two generation behind would drop price I would mess around sell deal scatter bay shady trade site phone upgrade program I I I like easy willing pay extra convenience always new reliable phone late teach send return shipping box ready go strange I apple product maybe people less likely frequently update perhaps apple commit regular update product offer mac I would definitely long period two year upgrade four year pay pad apple watch I would probably pay since I keep long hand family would nice upgrade cool new thing arrive I really want like jet black titanic old mack pro g face I tiny bell allow display roughly current size

It also provides lower latency and has better network management so if say you’re at a large music festival then your device will be able to handle the traffic to the towers and perform still.
