It appears to be a calculation of the trade deficit (Exports to US: $12.7 billion - Imports from US: $0.3216 billion = $12.3784 billion) divided by Cambodia's exports to US ($12.7 billion) = approximately 97%.",epidemiks,82,1743644212.0,cambodia charge flat tariff import even close appear calculation trade deficit export billion import billion billion divide cambodia export billion approximately

ml4t8tn,"97%? Its a misleading figure. Here is how it work explained by a business expert Arnuad Darc

How Cambodia Applies Tariffs to U.S. Goods

Cambodia is a WTO member and applies the Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff schedule to countries like the United States, which has no free trade agreement with Cambodia.

1.	‚Å†Import Duty

‚Ä¢	‚Å†MFN tariff rates range from 0% to 35%, depending on the product category.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†For example: ‚Ä¢ Mobile phones: 0% ‚Ä¢ Wines: 35% ‚Ä¢ Processed foods: 15‚Äì35%

1.	‚Å†Value Added Tax (VAT) ‚Ä¢ A flat 10% VAT is applied to most imports.
2.	‚Å†Special Tax (Excise) ‚Ä¢ Applies only to specific goods, such as: ‚Ä¢ Alcohol (10‚Äì35%) ‚Ä¢ Vehicles (10‚Äì45%, depending on engine size) ‚Ä¢ Tobacco (up to 20%)
3.	‚Å†Public Lighting Tax (PLT) ‚Ä¢ 3%, but only on certain luxury goods.

‚∏ª

Real Example: Importing a Bottle of U.S. Wine

HS Code: 2204 ‚Ä¢ Import Duty: 35% ‚Ä¢ Special Tax: 35% ‚Ä¢ VAT: 10%

Total tax burden? About 100% ‚Äî but only on this specific item.

Now, consider importing a laptop from the U.S. ‚Äî ‚Ä¢ Import Duty: 0% ‚Ä¢ VAT: 10% ‚Ä¢ No special taxes.

Total tax burden? Just 10%.

This is how tariffs are applied: product-by-product, by HS Code, not by country-wide blanket percentages.",PhotojournalistTough,7,1743646045.0,mislead figure work explain business expert around dark cambodia apply tariff good cambodia member apply favor nation man tariff schedule country like unite state free trade agreement cambodia import duty man tariff rate range depend product category example mobile phone wine process food value add tax vat flat vat apply import special tax excise apply specific good alcohol vehicle depend engine size tobacco public lighting tax put certain luxury good real example import bottle wine code import duty special tax vat total tax burden specific item consider import lawton import duty vat special taxis total tax burden tariff apply productbyproduct code countryside blanket percentage

ml5l7wu,"Please, Cambodia is the worst country in the world when it comes to importing things from the USA.

Let‚Äôs assume the CIF (Cost + Insurance + Freight) value of the Suburban imported into Cambodia from the USA is $40,000:

‚∏ª

Tax Breakdown (Engine > 3,000 cc)
	1.	Customs Duty (35%):
35% of $40,000 = $14,000
	2.	Special Tax (50%):
50% of $40,000 = $20,000
	3.	VAT (10% of CIF + Duty + Special Tax):
10% of ($40,000 + $14,000 + $20,000) =
10% of $74,000 = $7,400

‚∏ª

Total Taxes & Duties =
	‚Ä¢	$14,000 (Customs Duty)
	‚Ä¢	$20,000 (Special Tax)
	‚Ä¢	$7,400 (VAT)
= $41,400

Percentage of CIF:

41,400 / 40,000 x 100 = 103.5%

So, you‚Äôre paying about 103.5% of the CIF value in import taxes and duties for a Chevrolet Suburban in Cambodia imported from the US.

How Cambodia Applies Tariffs to U.S. GoodsCambodia is a WTO member and applies the Most Favored Nation (MFN) tariff schedule to countries like the United States, which has no free trade agreement with Cambodia.1. Import Duty - MFN tariff rates range from 0% to 35%, depending on the product category. - For example:    ‚Ä¢ Mobile phones: 0%    ‚Ä¢ Wines: 35%    ‚Ä¢ Processed foods: 15‚Äì35%2. Value Added Tax (VAT) ‚Ä¢ A flat 10% VAT is applied to most imports.3. Special Tax (Excise) ‚Ä¢ Applies only to specific goods, such as: ‚Ä¢ Alcohol (10‚Äì35%) ‚Ä¢ Vehicles (10‚Äì45%, depending on engine size) ‚Ä¢ Tobacco (up to 20%)4. Public Lighting Tax (PLT) ‚Ä¢ 3%, but only on certain luxury goods.‚∏ªReal Example: Importing a Bottle of U.S. WineHS Code: 2204 ‚Ä¢ Import Duty: 35% ‚Ä¢ Special Tax: 35% ‚Ä¢ VAT: 10%Total tax burden? About 100% ‚Äî but only on this specific item.Now, consider importing a laptop from the U.S. ‚Äî ‚Ä¢ Import Duty: 0% ‚Ä¢ VAT: 10% ‚Ä¢ No special taxes.Total tax burden? Just 10%.This is how tariffs are applied: product-by-product, by HS Code, not by country-wide blanket percentages.‚∏ªSo, where did the 97% number come from?It‚Äôs unclear. It doesn‚Äôt match Cambodia‚Äôs Customs Tariff Book, nor data from the WTO, ASEAN Trade Repository, or Cambodia‚Äôs General Department of Customs and Excise.Most likely, it‚Äôs a political construct, lumping together: ‚Ä¢ Import duties ‚Ä¢ VAT ‚Ä¢ Special taxes (only for a few goods) ‚Ä¢ Regulatory ‚Äúfrictions‚Äù ‚Ä¢ Possibly, perceived ‚Äútrade barriers‚ÄùBut treating it as an across-the-board tariff is disinformation.",CraigInCambodia,0,1743720231.0,I know I live say troop excuse \ cambodia apply tariff godscambodia member apply favor nation man tariff schedule country like unite state free trade agreement cambodia import duty man tariff rate range depend product category example mobile phone wine process food value add tax vat flat vat apply import special tax excise apply specific good alcohol vehicle depend engine size tobacco public lighting tax put certain luxury godsreal example import bottle wine code import duty special tax vat total tax burden specific itemnow consider import lawton import duty vat special taxestotal tax burden tariff apply productbyproduct code countryside blanket percentage number come profit unclear match cambodia custom tariff book datum see trade depositor cambodia general department custom excisemost likely political construct jump together import duty vat special taxis good regulatory friction possibly perceive trade bariersbut treat acrostheboard tariff disinformation

The US will be fine in comparison, as they have the ability to produce all the stuff cambodia was exporting (albeit at a higher cost causing pain) and wasnt exporting much to cambodia anyways so no loss there.

Cambodia in return will have a bunch of factories/goods with no customers.  And china isnt gonna be able to step up and buy all of asias stuff like the US was.  And if they did, it would harm their economy.

Or have numerous factories shut down cause it has not more customers, affecting the entire area around that factory that was supplying jobs not just at the factory but servicing the people that worked there such as restaurants maintenance people, taxis, selling goods to those employees etc.

Its not like cambodia was in a good place to start.  This will wreck them as chinese factories in cambodia will shut down.  Theres a reason why countries are panicking. Even giants like japan.

Why isnt the US? Cause it has the ability to produce most of what it needs.",Educational_Face6507,0,1743694982.0,favorable favorable comparison bad dollar shirt get dollar numerous factory shut cause customer affect entire area around factory supply job factory serve people work restaurant maintenance people taxis sell good employee etc like cambodia good place start wreck chinese factory cambodia shut reason country pack even giant like japan cause ability produce need

ml7x4qd,"If you have a $15 shirt instead of $10 then that means the shop in Cambodia is already closed. We don't know what the impact will be. For sure both inflation and unemployment have caused social unrest historically.  Obviously, nobody wins in this case. So, again the solution is to avoid this from happening.. to negotiate.. but for what and how? Should this negotiation happen before making actions. Trump admin is just 3 months old, did they already do the work and this is the last resort? They already fired the shot.. shotgun shot.",UpperHand888,2,1743695878.0,shirt instead mean shop cambodia already close know impact sure inflation unemployment cause social unrest historically obviously nobody win case solution avoid happen negotiate negotiation happen make action tramp admit month old already work last resort already fire shoot shotgun shoot
