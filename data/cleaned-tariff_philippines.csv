If you don't care about rule of law at all what you can do is draw up the walls around your economy (ie tariffs etc.,)  then you start giving exemptions to those walls as a form of reward for loyalty/political favoritism. Now you get to pick the 'winners' and 'losers' domestically in the economy and you can make it clear that access to wealth flows from you and your faction and nowhere else. 

Once you've got that you have the power to create and destroy economically and you can entrench yourself with a loyal class of cronies who are 'invested' in the new system and whose primary 'expertise' over time will shift to currying political favor rather than running efficient and innovative businesses. They'll know that so they'll help entrench and protect the new crony centric system rather than push for competition. The country as a whole will get poorer, but you and your buds will be very difficult to unseat and your relative power domestically will be extremely high. Any new powers that arise you either coopt into the system or use the system to crush them.

From what I can remember from history class, there was already a recession in US during the early 1920s. I think 1 in 3 americans were unemployed. The then president signed a bill imposing tariffs on select goods in the hopes that Americans would buy local goods and encourage employment. Lobbyists, wanting a piece of the pie, also managed to convince the president to include pretty much everything.

Since US is an import economy, it backfired. Other nations put a blanket tariff hike on them which cascaded into a global scale.  People panicked and pulled out their stocks further tanking the market.

Trump's plan is the same. The US is still an import economy. They don't even have the infrastructure to support the plan. Americans will never accept a low pay.

And usually, tariffs are negotiated between countries, not like what Trump is doing now where it's unilaterally changed, because it encourages hostile actions between countries like what's happening now.

And the US can just produce on their own, but they won't, because it's cheaper to import. Trump and the GOP can cry all they want, but that fact cannot be undone by just imposing random tariffs against other countries. The US is a post-industrial developed nation, and other countries will just have lower wages and lower production costs, no matter how much they b\*tch and moan about it.

If they don't want it, and they feel that buying imports is at the ""expense of Americans"", then have them tell their citizens to stop importing.
