ml5hr65,"Vietnam will not pay a 46% tariff. Trump wants Vietnam to bend the knee and make a deal. I don‚Äôt know what that deal is but I know it will enrich Trump. 

It will probably also include Vietnam purchasing more long dated treasuries to help the US refinance all of its debt coming due. 

Not to get too into the weeds but if you‚Äôre interested read some of the writings of Scott Bessent who is the new Secretary of the Treasury. This is a strong arm scare tactic to reset the world order a bit. It‚Äôs totally playing with fire but that‚Äôs a big part of it.",nichef,36,1743656484.0

ml5f3ru,"I have a masters degree in economics and business administration, for what its worth. There is a lot of misinformation or ignorance about tariffs, that's why my lengthy reply:

Short version:
Dont worry this isnt good but it's not as huge as it sounds, tariffs are on CUSTOMS VALUE, not retail value meaning that the cost of these tariffs aren't going to cut into the revenue THAT much, especially since some of the tariff cost will get forwarded to American customers. Some products will be hit hard but those generally don't offer that many jobs Anyway. In the end, vietnam has the opportunity to trade with other markets as those also will get tariffs by usa. Being less dependent on the USA is a good thing. 

Long version;

It won't ruin the entire economy. Some % the companies will absorb, some % will be passed on to the consumer. This is temporary. Even if it lasts for years, Trump will be gone in 3.7 years. And probably a Democrat will be elected next to fix the horrid mess trump will leave behind and abandoned these foolish measures.

Also don't forget the usa already has tariffs on these goods. Example on clothing the tariff is already around 19%, so that's still going to be increased but it's not from 0 to 46. (NOTE: doesn't apply if it's an extra blanket tariff)

Anyway heres more info about a tariff;

A t-shirt on sale for 10 dollar in USA doesn't mean the company needs to pay a 46% tariff on 10 dollar, the value of an imported t-shirt (also called the customs value) is more like 1 or 2 dollar. So a tariff of 46% could be 46-92 cents. So a 10 dollar tshirt will cost 10.50 or 11. There will be a smaller demand as that always happens when price goes up, but won't be a lot as clothing is a necessity. Same applies to much of its textiles and lesser extend the shoes. Other products like tech etc will have less big margins so will hurt a bit more but American households will feel that pain more and the companies can look to try to sell to others, worst case they move part of production and vietnam loses some jobs, but many of those companies just came to vietnam after heavy investments. So we will need to wait an see

Of course on a national scale that's big numbers, but on the micro level it's being blown a bit out of proportion. And consumers are on a micro level.

For (European) cars and raw materials the issue is much bigger as a car or raw materials being imported already has close to the sale value and profit margins aren't that big. But most of what vietnam exports isn't high cost. So don't worry. 

Also, the USA is tariffing most of the world, everyone will be looking for new/more markets. So, Vietnam can do the one thing which is the biggest asset you can have in business-> a diversified market/portfolio (as in, less dependency on USA, trade more with EU, China, Africa, ...) 

In the end, this only damages the USA long-term, as they lose standing and trade relations, and their consumers will pay more for EVERYTHING. The US doesn't have enough workers to take back all that production. He must know this due to his team of advisors. So, one must wonder wtf are Republicans trying to do over there. (Putting on my conspiracy hat) Working for Putin or Xi seems doubtful, my guess is just they want to destabilize the USA to get more power. Basically a conservative coup of the nation. Which is scary since they have a lot of aircraft carriers and nukes üòÖ",BelgianDudeInDenmark,80,1743655161.0

	1.	It takes a long time to build factories
	2.	It‚Äôs not easy to move production lines

As someone who used to place those orders, I can say both are incredibly easy. For complex assembly, such as electronics, it might take some time to build something on a large scale and hire qualified workers; but most of the delay comes from obtaining permits. The actual construction and recruitment process can be as fast as 1 month for a garment factory. Moving production can happen overnight. 

Regarding concerns about whether Americans would work for $2 per hour to produce shoes: fashion items are low frequency purchases. If retail prices increase, consumers will simply reduce their buying frequency.

From a vietnamese export perspective nobody gives a shit about retail value, its always only been customs value thats been relevant.¬†


The final impact on consumers may be less than 46%, but after years of inflation disposable income is already tight, it is hard to imagine just how much it is going to cripple demand.


>Some % the companies will absorb, some % will be passed on to the consumer.


If it was 10-20% margin, maybe. There are many jndustries that do not have 46% margins across the whole chain of supply to absorb it. You think 3.7 years is short? If youre losing money you wont keep operations going longer than a few months.


>Vietnam can do the one thing which is the biggest asset you can have in business-> a diversified market/portfolio

In fact this blanket tariff is extremely questionable. It will cause basically the entire world to look for new markets and they will find them, because the USA was such a big trade partner, some countries didn't need to find other partners, but now they do. For example, Vietnam exports 30% to usa. But not much to EU. Thats because of American companies in vietnam, producing here and then sending to usa. These companies can shift some of their stock to EU or EU companies could come here if attracted by some attractive trade deals.

This will suck a bit on the short term but in the longterm it will mean vietnam is less dependent on USA, has a more diversified market/partner network.

Also take into consideration that these tariffs are on customs value, not retail value. So a 10 dollar tshirt imported from vietnam won't suddenly cost 14.6 dollar but more like 10.46-10.92 dollar.
