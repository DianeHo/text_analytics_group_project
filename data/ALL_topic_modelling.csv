I don't know enough about stocks and politics, so I can't properly comment.

I don't have a vendetta, I'm a loyalist since s6 edge.

Just frustrating to see how trash their updates have become. I'm invested in the ecosystem, and used to the OS. I use heaps of Samsung exclusive features others don't (like the Spen, I use it daily.

I'm not getting a copy and paste. 


Also as far as your statement about other brands not having more or better features. Let me correct you.. Let's take a One plus 13 as an example. 


6000ma battery
120w fast charging 
4500nits
2k screen
8 gen elite 
IP69 water proof


or let's take the vivo x200 pro




6000ma battery 
Log video (raw) 
4500 nits
90w fast charging


Or let's take the Xiaomi 15 ultra 


1 inch camera sensor 
5400ma battery 
10bit LOG raw video 
90w fast charging 


Your telling me the s25 ultra has better specs than these? 😂 


If you are, you are seriously deluded and are just justifying whatever Samsung gives.. Samsung could take away all the cameras and put in a 10mp camera and you will still try your best to defend them


Also when a phone claims it's ULTRA or FLAGSHIP, I EXPECT ultra and flagship specs or else I would get a mid range phone 


Samsung has used the SAME camera sensor since the s21 ultra  Let this sink in your head or are you in denial 


""it's m13 plus, not m13""  Doesn't matter how you slice it or go around the bushes with it.. IT IS STILL THE OLDER M13. It isn't the NEWER M14 panel. Samsung are giving you older specs not new ones 


Also the only thing you mentioned is the new snap dragon 8 elite.. Guess what? EVERY FLAGSHIP from 2025 Is ALSO getting the 8 elite chip combined with all other flagship features I listed.. The s25 ultra has the 8 elite but has nothing else or old specs 


vivo, xiaomi, Oppo are all getting the new 8 gen elite . Your whole statement was based on the 8 gen elite. You probably thought the s25 ultra is the only one getting it 😂

For example, 

Better battery life can be achieved through throttling, limiting services, worse hardware, etc. 

Better picture/video quality can be achieved through software optimisations, fake ""AI"", etc. 

You would get better battery life and photos, but would you be happy with them being achieved through the above described methods? 

For me, I know exactly what the outcome would be from a silicon-carbon battery: Bigger battery, better battery life. 

A better camera hardware would result in more potential, which would either be unlocked immediately, or eventually, through a software update.",I think different approach end result mine exact step result certain outcome example well battery life achieve throttle limit service bad hardware etc well picturevideo quality achieve software optimisation face ai etc would get well battery life photo would happy achieve describe method I I know exactly outcome would siliconcarbon battery big battery well battery life well camera hardware would result potential would either unlocked immediately eventually software update

Some people must be really sensitive to the animations or something because I never have any (noticeable) bugs on third party launchers with pixels or with Samsung for that matter. Outside of Android 10.

Maybe it's b. I turn animations down to .5 anyways but to me I don't notice it at

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI. 

Like the fact that you can't customize launchers on either of the stock launchers right there is reason enough for me to switch to Nova.

Again, it's totally fine if a consumer KNOWS they are getting a mid-range chip and still chooses to pay for a pixel, there's plenty to love about them. But as consumers, we shouldn't gaslight our fellow consumers that they're not overpaying or that they aren't receiving a mid-range product for $1000+.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals

But I would argue there should be a high performance mode in the settings at least and that people should be aware that they're battery life is improved because of throttling. 

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated. Frankly I actually think 8g2 is a better trip than 8g3 and 8g4 (whatever it's called now) because when you see honest testing of the better you find out that both of those require more power on their sustained load.

But the pixel has much better stuff for like call screening, a much better recorder app. Much quicker updates, a much more interesting beta program. Doesn't use a horizontal app drawer, it's much easier to move apps to the home screen (Samsung forces you to click long press find app and then once again move it).

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher. 

Also Samsung has 60 GB of system storage instead of like 15. The updates are faster in terms of time it takes to accomplish with Samsung but you can't use the phone while it's updating.

> The key new features include the A18 chip, which provides enhanced performance and supports Apple Intelligence, faster charging, the Action Button, an enhanced ultra wide camera with support for macro photography, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 retains a similar design to the iPhone 15. The color palette has become more vibrant, with options like Ultramarine, Pink, and Teal. The camera arrangement has also been redesigned, moving from the previous diagonal layout to a vertical stack, a change that helps enable Spatial Video and Photo capture for the Vision Pro headset.

> Among the standout additions to the ‌iPhone‌ 16 is the introduction of the Action Button and the Camera Control. Previously exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the Action Button is a customizable button that replaces the traditional mute switch, offering users flexibility to assign various functions such as starting voice memos or launching shortcuts. Meanwhile, the new Camera Control capacitive button, located on the right side of the device, takes smartphone photography to the next level by mimicking a physical shutter button. It also integrates gestures for adjusting settings like zoom, exposure, and more.

> One of the ‌iPhone‌ 16's key features is support for Apple Intelligence. While many of these features are still on the way with future software updates, the A18 chip underpins the phone's ability to handle the AI tools, offering improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and overall user experience.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 brings several key camera upgrades, including an improved ultra wide camera, with support for macro photography for the first time on a standard ‌iPhone‌ model.

And they've already contracted TSMC to make the new ones while Samsung is now having to move mediatek. So it's going to be funny when Samsung fans have to turn around and say performance doesn't matter in a couple years. 

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance. But when the Pixel 6 came out they were competing against the 888 which was also fabricated by Samsung and a complete s*** show. Pixel 7 pro came out it was competing against 8g1... Also fabricated by Samsung and also a complete s*** show. 


So honestly the performance doesn't bother me what bothers me is the constant price increases, the stupid AI b*******.

But you get an unlocked bootloader and a much better beta program and a much better camera. 

I just I don't know why people are so solely focused on the performance of the chip when Android OS is such that the performance of the chip doesn't really matter.

Not only that, everyone benefits when technical advancements are prioritized, because everything has tradeoffs or worse performance outright without them.  Take raw SoC performance vs battery life.  They are two sides of the same coin.  More efficient transistors means outcomes like better performance with the same battery life, or the same performance with better battery life.

This past Friday morning I woke up and the phone was completely fried, as in dead. It gave me zero warning and something tells me the last security update after at least 4 days would not download as I tried about 10 times.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far. 

The S22 battery Is well documented as being terrible because of its size, and I'm enjoying a lot more battery life and just a different phone which in my mind might as well be Androids flagship. It's solid AF. 
The S series Samsungs are great, but the time had come for a change

I'm an Android fanboi 🏃‍♂️ and I'll fight anyone with my fists if needed at any time If they start talking smack about iPhone being so much better than Android. Of course I'm joking kind of ...because I sucker punch them and run for my life
