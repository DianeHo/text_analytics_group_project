Some people must be really sensitive to the animations or something because I never have any (noticeable) bugs on third party launchers with pixels or with Samsung for that matter. Outside of Android 10.

Maybe it's b. I turn animations down to .5 anyways but to me I don't notice it at

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI. 

Like the fact that you can't customize launchers on either of the stock launchers right there is reason enough for me to switch to Nova. 

Double tapping for my remote control or swiping up and down on icons for shortcuts should be available on every these devices.",I use third party launch pipe I find problem people must really sensitive animation something I never noticeable bag third party launch pipe samson matter outside andros maybe b I turn animation anyway I I notice I say exist I know new version andros restrict launch ability access certain axis I nova launch great experience fix way well stock launch I would say thing samson although I hear exact opposite thing fact I explicitly read article explain nova launch work well pipe samson case whatever bag limitation exist I find third party launch like nova way well one I fix home screen I know third party launch organize try get access animation thing control I think andros could hospitable launch I know user experience way superior fix launch one I like fact customize launch either stock launch right reason enough I switch nova double tap remote control wipe icon shortcut available every device

In which case maybe you're happy about the throttling. But I would argue there should be a high performance mode in the settings at least and that people should be aware that they're battery life is improved because of throttling. 

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated. Frankly I actually think 8g2 is a better trip than 8g3 and 8g4 (whatever it's called now) because when you see honest testing of the better you find out that both of those require more power on their sustained load.

That's why we're seeing so many bigger batteries this year although the difference was not very drastic 8g3

For example, 

Better battery life can be achieved through throttling, limiting services, worse hardware, etc. 

Better picture/video quality can be achieved through software optimisations, fake ""AI"", etc. 

You would get better battery life and photos, but would you be happy with them being achieved through the above described methods?

Phone features people desire don't work in a vacuum, just like any other product that has various features that make them appealing vs another.  If performance was all that matters rather than how it was achieved, then why bother making a plane more aerodynamic when you could just strap a bigger engine to it?  Because it costs fuel.  

Not only that, everyone benefits when technical advancements are prioritized, because everything has tradeoffs or worse performance outright without them.  Take raw SoC performance vs battery life.  They are two sides of the same coin.  More efficient transistors means outcomes like better performance with the same battery life, or the same performance with better battery life.

All of that said from the user experience I do not notice any complaints with it. I do recall with Android 10 sometimes The gestures would break on some devices but on newer models whatever limitations they have to the animations I do not notice. 

Maybe it's bc I turn animations down to .5

Whatever the limitations are I find Nova launcher to be way better than both the home screen for the Pixel or the one UI. Like you can't customize gestures on those or resize the grid beyond a few presets.

Pixel launcher is probably the most obnoxious in terms of not being able to remove the widgets but Samsung has the worst app drawer in the game at least out of all the phones I've used. And the vertical app drawer available in good lock is not good either.

Honestly I think there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones 

I won't repeat all the criticisms for the s25 since at this point they're well known but I am normally a pixel user and I love the new design ever since the Pixel 6.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals 

I am really excited to see what TSMC will do to the pixels but if you didn't like the Pixel 8 pro it's bizarre that everyone like the Pixel 9 pro. It seems like it's just bc it looks more like an iPhone 

I would much rather have the pixel 8 pro and you can find it for 350 bucks on Amazon renewed.",scrutinize consumer report honestly I think plenty criticism phone I repeat criticism since point well know I normally fix user I love new design ever since fix I frustrate year seem opinion least north america couture double standard pipe I think coverage unfair strange medium opinion turn fix device since internal functional identical silicon still samson time yet performance barely different old device functional difference square design cost money year row price increase case fix pro go model get fix pro still go storage inferior samson internal I really excite see time pipe like fix pro bizarre everyone like fix pro seem like bc look like phone I would much rather fix pro find buck amazon renew

But yes if I'm using a Samsung phone or a Pixel phone 2025 I'm changing to a third party launcher for 80% of my use.

The S25 series is the perfect example of this. Even the S24 series in Europe proved this too as the S24 & S24+ ship with a vastly inferior chip than what other flagships offer.


Then we have Google, held back by the Tensor. The owners of Android can't/won't offer a device with flagship performance,  or at least a device that's priced to match. Their cameras are seriously good, and Google has a good thing with the design and software. But performance sucks. Period. I never had as bad of performance in Firefox than i did on my Pixel  7Pro.

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far.

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance.
