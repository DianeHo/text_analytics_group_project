It just makes everything astronomically more expensive in the short-medium run.The only thing this will probably accomplish is lining the pockets of their administration while leaving average american folk high and dry.

Quick math using the numbers published by the US Office of Trade (USTR) does seem to add up:

[Vietnam](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/vietnam): $123.5B/$136.6B = 90.4% -> 46%  
[Singapore](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/singapore): -$2.8B/$43.2B < 0 -> 10%  
[China](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/china-mongolia-taiwan/peoples-republic-china): $295.4B/$438.9B = 67.3% -> 34%

And considering the extremely high tariff put on Cambodia, Vietnam, it's pretty obvious the reason for that is because China currently circumvents the tariffs on China by routing to these countries which don't have beef with the US. It's trying to discourage this behaviour.

Side note: There is this economic experiment where you give Participant A $10 and tell him “it is up to you to give however much you want to Participant B”. They ran this experiment in many different countries. But they also ran a different experiment— you give Participant B $10 and tell Participant A “you take however much you want from Participant B”. The starkest thing about running these experiments in America, is that some Americans as A will give money to B or even give all of the money— but in the alternative experiment, a lot of Americans will choose to take most if not all money from Participant B. What this means is that, if they perceive they are higher in status than you, some might be generous. But if they think “you are acting like you are better than me”, a lot of them will react with blind anger and try to take everything at least in that experiment. What we are now seeing might be the irl version of that second scenario.

Plus it invites retaliatory tariffs that hit companies and stocks like Tesla, which actually affect many members of the trump administration personally. The reason why Trump is doing this is that 1)countries had historically made extortionist trade agreements with the United States that placed tariffs on its goods while painting it as legitimate versus when the US actually tariffs them back, 2) making the US less reliant on foreign labor. Sure, the Canada tariff might be trumps own bone to pick with Trudeau, but the trade issue is much more pertinent than it seems. Millions of automation and manufacturing jobs have been steadily lost, and despite the Obama efforts during his term to ""encourage local"" that has done absolutely Jack. Whereas the trump tariffs forced countries like Apple to return their HQ back to the US from countries like China and promised trillions of investment. And finally 3) it pressured countries into finally doing what the US wants, forcing Venezuela to accept their deported migrants, to force Canada to be willing to drop their tariffs, to get Mexico to enforce their border more strictly, to get the EU more self reliant and spend more on their own defense and military.

Manufacturing takes time to prop up, so the price of goods in the USA will increase in the short-term. Even when the goods start to be made in the USA, do you really think they'll reduce the prices?

The reason EU is getting more self reliant is not tariffs, it's Trump's threat to annex European territories, pulling support from Ukraine, and making comments about supplying allies with sub standard equipment.

ml4m8a6,"\> Revenue collected from tariffs has never been remotely great compared to a flat out local tax.

Revenue is still revenue. Having foreign tariffs is just a front to indirectly tax the average consumer. And all that will probably fund tax cuts for the ultra rich.

\> Plus it invites retaliatory tariffs that hit companies and stocks like Tesla, which actually affect many members of the trump administration personally

I don't disagree with this, its not wrong. Plenty of trump supporters/administration personnel have spoken out against tariffs. In the short/medium term, the market will go down and net value will be lost. Long term however, large corporations who have the financial ability to weather through will start absorbing and consolidating smaller, local business that go bankrupt, taking up a larger market share. I don't have to tell you why a monopoly is bad right?

\>countries had historically made extortionist trade agreements with the United States that placed tariffs on its goods while painting it as legitimate

Extortionist trade agreements? What planet are you living on? A trade deficit resulting from imports and exports is not extortion. The US has enjoyed decades of discounted imports of raw material and manufactured goods due to their soft power. Through the stability of the American dollar and security guarantees.

\> making the US less reliant on foreign labor. Sure, the Canada tariff might be trumps own bone to pick with Trudeau, but the trade issue is much more pertinent than it seems. Millions of automation and manufacturing jobs have been steadily lost, and despite the Obama efforts during his term to ""encourage local"" that has done absolutely Jack.

I don't disagree. American corporations have gotten used to outsourcing, using cheap labour to increase profit margins. But taking a sledgehammer at your allies and the your economy is not the way to do it. And Obama doing absolutely jack? Are you high? Manufacturing and jobs grew as a result of his administration. It wasn't instant or dramatic. Its a slow but thought out long term event. One that didn't require the wreckage of the economy and risk the livelihood of the American worker.

\> Whereas the trump tariffs forced countries like Apple to return their HQ back to the US from countries like China and promised trillions of investment.

Apple has done that before. Always promising to put in the investment when threatened with tariffs. But whether it actually becomes fact is another thing. But why risk tariffs? Why use the stick when you can use the carrot? Especially when you are the global hegemony? The CHIPS act is an example of a much safer way of bringing semiconductor research and manufacturing to the US.

\> it pressured countries into finally doing what the US wants, forcing Venezuela to accept their deported migrants, to force Canada to be willing to drop their tariffs, to get Mexico to enforce their border more strictly, to get the EU more self reliant and spend more on their own defense and military

I'm not going to comment about the Venezuelan migrant issue as I'm not well enough informed. But I will say this. America just lost its near global demand for its defense and weapons industry. While the EU wasn't self reliant on their own defense, having American equipment locked them in to the American defense pipeline. American equipment means American training, supplies, parts, contractors. From an economic standpoint, I don't understand why you wouldn't want that. You get leverage over your allies for better economic negotiations in return for American defense tech and equipment, while also being able to secure regional interests. Another example of soft power.

\> A tariff war hurts everyone, but you bet that countries in the EU have more to lose than the United States

Yes. But no one had to get hurt. America effectively just ended its decades long global hegemony. Guess who has more to gain than to lose? Russia, China. You effectively handed them everything on a silver platter. China will use this opportunity to fill in the gaps left behind by the US, to secure regional interests and secure more of the global export market share.

ml4z9i9,"First up, revenue collected from tariffs will not be able to pay for tax cuts for the rich. There is a reason why now the trump administration in budget negotiations is considering a scrap on the planned tax cuts because they know that the revenue from tariffs will not be able to pay for it. Revenue collected from tariffs are estimated to only generate 600 billion in a span of over 10 years, a far cry from the trillions required to pay for ""tax cuts"" per a nonpartisan economic analysis

Tariffs hit large corporations and benefit small businesses more. Large corporations consistently rip off products from China and lower costs that attract Americans to not buy local. By increasing these prices, Americans will have more options to settle on these local businesses who are producing at first higher prices but are now at a competitive pricing.

Thirdly, yes, it has been extortionist. The EU had applied over a 10 percent tariff on US cars versus a 2.5 percent tariff back in 2018, while it had over a 17.6 percent tariff rate on dairy products. Other countries too had been enjoying a much higher tariff rate on external goods than the US, as per the pew research and the WTO. The US had enjoyed decreased pricing but being increasingly reliant on others and just gutting its ability to rely on itself is not the America we want.

Fourthly, yes Obama had done absolutely Jack. Between 1994 and 2010, the US lost over 4 million auto manufacturing jobs as a result of globalization and a million or more was due to NAFTA that Obama was wholeheartedly supporting. This prevented the industry from rebounding after the Great Recession. Compare that to Trump who added 500000 manufacturing jobs between 2017-2019, the largest increase since NAFTA. Moreover, the recent jobs report from the last three months overall had mostly disproportionate increase in local, citizen held jobs instead of foreign labor.

Apple has committed to this investment and I can bet it will occur because it's a five year investment and trumps term will still last three more years, not counting the fact that even democrat administrations are reluctant to loosen up on tariffs.

America losing its global demand? Nope. Countries are gonna be self reliant but as of now, the US still provides a majority of the security guarantee in Europe and other places. They spend by far the most on NATO, and many of these contributions have been used to give Europe a soft pillow while Europe had spent lavishly on their social programs.

Europe has no ability to rely on themselves. They are in precarious political situations, and many of them still relied on Russian gas till a few years ago. Getting Europe to spend more as a result of trumps threats? Exactly what he wants, because when he made that speech on the UN at 2018 directed at Germany for being reliant on Russia he got laughed at.

Who has more to gain and to Lose? Russia and China? Are you kidding me? The Russian economy is now in tatters and they are hurling their men into a meat machine. They've also lost their footing in Syria after Assad lost. China can gloat, but look at the countries it had impacted in the belt and road initiative.

Apart from everything becoming more expensive for consumers, it also makes it very difficult for American companies to do business because their cost of raw materials would also go up in quite unpredictable ways.

Personally I view tariffs as a super dumb thing to do, but an argument is that domestic manufacturing can pick up the slack and more Americans buy American again.

Furthermore, you might be able to get more investment domestically, for example a chip manufacturer in Taiwan may choose to build a factory in US itself to bypass the tariff instead.

However, it's proven before that these positive effects don't outweigh the negatives (and there's a lot of them).

For example, imagine we usually get eggs from Malaysia for $3. Local producers will be competing with that price and will price their eggs the same.

If SG suddenly implements a 50% tariff on Malaysia eggs, the price for those will rise to $4.50.

ml4eod0,"Well that's the idea but the world is far too complex for this now. Think about manufacturing now. Raw materials, they need to import this at tariffed prices. With labour cost in the US, it likely is still cheaper to import than do it domestically. Also, with so many companies having production internationally, and exports internationally, no one will just shift back to a US production on a whim. For someone like apple, who was exempt from tariffs in the past, but not sure about how, they might take years to move all production back to the US if they wanted to. By then, trump will be gone or maybe more likely dead... So what then? Especially if the tariffs are lifted. 

Reciprocal tariffs will also make things so much more expensive. So US exports will likely lose out in many major markets.

And the worst part is, they will now have to depend on local consumption. But with the huge hit economies will take from this and how companies will look to cut cost and be safer now because of this. People will lose jobs and likely reduce local consumption.

ml4g4gu,"Short answer, Yes. 

Long answer: 

Simply put, in general, local goods in developed countries tend to cost more for the same quality due to multiple reasons such as wages, local laws and access to raw material. Tariffs are a way to jack up prices of foreign goods to make local goods pricing more competitive.

Usually this means that the cost of goods increases in the near to short term as consumers will have to pay more for things. 

Long term wise though, this benefits local companies who now have an increased volume which allows them theoretically to take advantage of economy of scale. It also incentivizes more companies to invest in the US to not have to pay tariffs. 


However, that's under the assumption that everyone has equal access to manpower, same laws and raw material. Vietnam is the best example of this. 

The working age group in Vietnam is the largest demographic in the country by far and they are willing to work hard for low income. 

Vietnam does not have stringent environmental laws or labour laws like the US does and I'm sure there are multiple ""black"" companies that make full use of this. 


Vietnam gets a large amount of it's raw materials from China which also has the same conditions, people in the countryside are often working long hours for little pay and lax environmental laws. 


In contrast, the US requires minimum wage for all employees and they have very strict environment laws. Factor in also that kids who are brought up in a comfortable environment do not want to slave away at textile factories working for pennies. 

And for raw material? The US grows lots of cotten but they can't even maintain their farms without the huge number of Mexican/ SA immigrants and with Trump's recent immigration laws its going to be harder to get people to work.


Overall on paper it sounds good to bring companies and jobs back to the US, but the problem is that Americans do not want these jobs.

Long answer: 

Entitled is the wrong word to use because nobody is going to stop any country from doing anything, that's a country's perogative. But it's the consequences that matter.

GST is a good example. It's not the most popular policy but big picture this policy is good for the country which by extension means its people / citizens.

If he truly wanted to help small businesses he'd increase taxes on large corporations or incentivize small scale local manufacturing. Why is he even trying tax cuts to begin with? Its not to the benefit of anyone but the ultra rich.

Tariffs =/= extortion. I do not have a thing against tariffs. They are an excellent tool to encourage local manufacturing. However, the way he is going about it is completely nonsensical. A trade deficit is not the metric to justify placing tariffs on everyone, even on countries with a trade surplus. You also have to remember the end cost is passed on to the consumer, not the government of the country. Tariffs have a higher negative impact on consumers.

ml58xlo,"A few obvious benefits. First, to mitigate reduced demand, importers of coffee and chocolate are likely to reduce prices paid to suppliers. Second, as has been correctly pointed out a tariff is a form of tax. If taxes are increased in one area in the form of tariffs, they can be reduced in other areas such as income while maintaining the net value of tax revenue.

I would like to add though, regarding your example regarding cotton. Yes, no local born and bred American wants these jobs.

ml5uc0n,"Yes many Chinese consumers prefer to choose the foreign brand because it oozes luxury in their minds and gives them status. These brands get tax breaks when they force themselves to manufacture in China then sell locally. That’s applied to offset unfair asymmetrical tax making it harder for those companies to do business NORMALLY, as they would in the rest of the world.

Here’s another practical example to add to the long list I’ve given you already. Tax incentives are given for manufacturing locally in China, which can be substantial. Then, once a company does this, China uses it as a method to demand ransom by threatening to remove the products from the market if their rulings aren’t imposed. For example, Apple was forced to move its iCloud service on to chinese servers and remove protections because the government threatened them with measures and Apple – not being able to say no to this due to making use of the incentives – was forced to comply. *On a CHINESE IPHONE, the TAIWAN FLAG EMOJI IS CENSORED.* This kind of stuff adds a lot of operational cost. Added work and labour and manpower. A hidden tax of doing business and selling in China.

A common argument to this is ""then don't do business in China! You don't have to access our market of 1.5 billion people,"" but *THAT is the entire POINT*.

Untrue. Tariffs are allowed and are normal as part of WTO rules for non high income economies(like China, Vietnam, Thailand etc). Unilateral tariffs(USA) are not allowed. The US itself made these rules during the formation of the WTO. Now it doesn't want to adhere to the rules that itself made.

I've added in the ""let's say"" *to the benefit of your argument*. The reality is that farmers do no have empty land just lying around that they can now fill with cotton to respond to these tariffs. 

>If manual labor was the solution, I wonder why, when you see footages of car assembly and manufacturing plants, you see robotic arms and not hundreds of human labor involved.

You should ask yourself - where do the car assembly robots come from, how long did it take to R&D them, how much did it cost, and then whether any of this is realistic in the context of the current tariffs that could change in a few years time. 

>Transition from manual labor to automation is not a revolution, it's an evolution. 

This is exactly the point. Automation takes **time and money**. Foreign cotton being expensive does not suddenly mean that American farmers will have robots to solve their labour problem. Tariffs are an artificial market factor rather than any genuine market force that would incentivize automation. If the tariffs are removed, countries like Vietnam can produce cheap foreign cotton. 

>America will not run out of cotton

It won't - it will just buy imported cotton at a higher price. Even that higher price is likely to be cheaper than spending time and money on an R&D program to automate things.

Probably not all. But they will likely move some of their production back to the US if nothing else but to act as a pseudo business continuity plan in the case of a trade war with China.

>tariffs for importing all the raw materials into US

Tariffs can be waived for a wide variety of reasons. Very likely, the tariffs on raw materials that feed into the manufacturing pipeline of these companies operating in the US will be waived. Especially since the whole purpose of them was to encourage local manufacturing.

But It's all speculation at this point from either end. So we have to wait and see.

Point is, you have to start somewhere and hopefully, and eventually the car manufacturers did. It may change in a few years time, and thus, humans should all hibernate and not do anything? Be my guest to do so, cause change is the only constant in life. Either adapt to the change, or not survive. 

>This is exactly the point. Automation takes **time and money**.

So does AI, where billions and manhours are invested. Has that stopped CHATGPT, or Deepseek? There is still no viable business model now, and yet companies and investors are charging on, with clear knowledge that in a few years time, technology may change and make AI obsolete. 

>Tariffs are an artificial market factor rather than any genuine market force that would incentivize automation. If the tariffs are removed, countries like Vietnam can produce cheap foreign cotton. 

Trade, by and in itself, is an artificial factor. In fact, US Dollar, being recognized by many countries as the global currency, is artificial. Being artificial does not mean anything. EU has introduced tariffs as well, for China made EVs. EU and USA has banned Huawei from participating in any Telecom Infrastructure bids. Singapore has import duties on import of Tobacco, Alcohol and Vehicles. So? Remove all these 'artificial' measures. Good luck in trying to push these changes. 

And you are assuming that Vietnam and other 3rd world countries would be happy staying at the bottom of the value chain and not desire to move up the value chain. 

>It won't - it will just buy imported cotton at a higher price. Even that higher price is likely to be cheaper than spending time and money on an R&D program to automate things.

Or not use cotton at all, if there is an urgent need,how does cloths made out of bamboo Fibres sound to you? Sure, Americans may possibly pay more for.cotton in the short term if they insist on using cotton, but there are also alternatives to cotton. So what if Americans are paying more? I'm not American.

What is this even going to mean lol. Countries will trade with each other. This trade is influenced by demand and supply. Countries like Vietnam have cheap supply of labour. Vietnam has a market advantage and will supply products that can use cheap labour to produce.
