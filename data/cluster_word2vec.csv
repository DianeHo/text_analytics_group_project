6,lnsjgwq,"> Today, select media outlets and YouTubers shared their first impressions of the iPhone 16 and ‌iPhone‌ 16 Plus, highlighting many of the incremental and notable updates.

> The key new features include the A18 chip, which provides enhanced performance and supports Apple Intelligence, faster charging, the Action Button, an enhanced ultra wide camera with support for macro photography, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 retains a similar design to the iPhone 15. The color palette has become more vibrant, with options like Ultramarine, Pink, and Teal. The camera arrangement has also been redesigned, moving from the previous diagonal layout to a vertical stack, a change that helps enable Spatial Video and Photo capture for the Vision Pro headset.

> Among the standout additions to the ‌iPhone‌ 16 is the introduction of the Action Button and the Camera Control. Previously exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the Action Button is a customizable button that replaces the traditional mute switch, offering users flexibility to assign various functions such as starting voice memos or launching shortcuts. Meanwhile, the new Camera Control capacitive button, located on the right side of the device, takes smartphone photography to the next level by mimicking a physical shutter button. It also integrates gestures for adjusting settings like zoom, exposure, and more.

> One of the ‌iPhone‌ 16's key features is support for Apple Intelligence. While many of these features are still on the way with future software updates, the A18 chip underpins the phone's ability to handle the AI tools, offering improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and overall user experience.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 brings several key camera upgrades, including an improved ultra wide camera, with support for macro photography for the first time on a standard ‌iPhone‌ model.
