1,m9ark0z,They said that indoor photography improved this generation. Didn't they say that before? I mostly traded in my S24 Ultra for the Pixel 9 Pro XL because I've always been a point-and-shooter. Indoor (with light!) would still take 5 seconds on the Galaxy. And would look worse than the screen grain everyone got. The only thing I'd add to the Pixel is more color options for the OS ☺️,Deleted,36,1737913170.0,say indoor photography improve generation say I mostly trade ultra fix pro I always pointandshoter indoor light would still take second galaxy would look bad screen grain everyone get thing I would add fix color option os,20

8,m9ann6s,"The S25 (especially the Ultra) is better. The Snapdragon chip inside is just objectively way more powerful. Google does come out on top with photos. Though, I'd say Samsung's cameras are still really good and competitive with Pixel and iPhones even if they're not upgrading the camera hardware as frequently as they used to. There's plenty to criticize Samsung about in terms of not doing enough to upgrade their phones from year to year, but the Ultra is still one of the best phones on the market right now. Especially if we're talking the NA market where there aren't really any of the Chinese phones to choose from. Not to mention, OneUI is the best version of Android right now. Super customizable with GoodLock, too.

I'm considering upgrading my S23 Ultra to the S25 Ultra even though there aren't *huge* improvements in a ton of areas. Samsung's trade offers, the free storage upgrade, etc. are good deals and are tempting me. I can get the phone for $550 with 512 GB of storage. If I wait for the S26 Ultra, it's likely my S23 Ultra will only be worth $500 or less instead of the $750 being offered for it now.

Honestly I think there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones 

I won't repeat all the criticisms for the s25 since at this point they're well known but I am normally a pixel user and I love the new design ever since the Pixel 6.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals 

I am really excited to see what TSMC will do to the pixels but if you didn't like the Pixel 8 pro it's bizarre that everyone like the Pixel 9 pro. It seems like it's just bc it looks more like an iPhone 

I would much rather have the pixel 8 pro and you can find it for 350 bucks on Amazon renewed.",Alternative-Farmer98,4,1737903283.0,scrutinize consumer report honestly I think plenty criticism phone I repeat criticism since point well know I normally fix user I love new design ever since fix I frustrate year seem opinion least north america couture double standard pipe I think coverage unfair strange medium opinion turn fix device since internal functional identical silicon still samson time yet performance barely different old device functional difference square design cost money year row price increase case fix pro go model get fix pro still go storage inferior samson internal I really excite see time pipe like fix pro bizarre everyone like fix pro seem like bc look like phone I would much rather fix pro find buck amazon renew,12

29,m9xxdzg,"So I started my Journey with a Samsung S9 in 2019 which lasted about 3 years and was on its last leg and was offered a free swap to the S22 base as I like smaller phones a couple of months after release.

This past Friday morning I woke up and the phone was completely fried, as in dead. It gave me zero warning and something tells me the last security update after at least 4 days would not download as I tried about 10 times.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far. 

The S22 battery Is well documented as being terrible because of its size, and I'm enjoying a lot more battery life and just a different phone which in my mind might as well be Androids flagship. It's solid AF. 
The S series Samsungs are great, but the time had come for a change

I mean it's frankly barely makes a difference whether you have a phone with an 865 or an 8g3. And that's like 5 years apart and I genuinely can't think of why One thing I couldn't do on the 865 that I would want to do.

But pixel has a lot of benefits over Samsung including no bloat, unlocked bootloader, faster shutter speed, better camera, better voice recording app. ... Way less proprietary stuff. For instance Samsung notes doesn't work on a Windows laptop that isn't a Galaxy book anymore. 


I don't think there's a winner here. Both of these companies are engaging in pretty anti-consumer s***. I think Pixel deserved a little more of a benefit of the doubt with the Pixel 6 and 7 when they were undercutting Samsung's pricing considerably. The Pixel 7 pro for instance was a solid $400 cheaper than the s22 ultra and $100 cheaper than the s22 Plus which only had a 1080p screen.

And they've already contracted TSMC to make the new ones while Samsung is now having to move mediatek. So it's going to be funny when Samsung fans have to turn around and say performance doesn't matter in a couple years. 

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance. But when the Pixel 6 came out they were competing against the 888 which was also fabricated by Samsung and a complete s*** show. Pixel 7 pro came out it was competing against 8g1... Also fabricated by Samsung and also a complete s*** show. 


So honestly the performance doesn't bother me what bothers me is the constant price increases, the stupid AI b*******.

But you get an unlocked bootloader and a much better beta program and a much better camera.

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated.

Doesn't use a horizontal app drawer, it's much easier to move apps to the home screen (Samsung forces you to click long press find app and then once again move it).

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher. 

Also Samsung has 60 GB of system storage instead of like 15. The updates are faster in terms of time it takes to accomplish with Samsung but you can't use the phone while it's updating. 

until this year the pixel was also a much better value proposition in terms of price where the pixel 7 pro for instance was $400 less than the s22 ultra and it started with 12 GB of RAM instead of 8

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI.
