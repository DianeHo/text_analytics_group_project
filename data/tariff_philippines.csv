May mabuti ding naidulot na hindi manufacturing export oriented ang economy natin unlike sa Vietnam at Thailand na super reliant sa pag export ng manufactured products. Kaya tuloy kapag may gulo sa international scene, ang unang tatamaan ay yung manufacturing sector.

So far, ang biggest strength ng PH economy are OFW's remittances and BPO sector, na puro nasa service sectors.  Mas diversified yung economy kaya kapag tinamaan yung isang sector like manufacturing, merong ibang sector na pwede mag step up para mag balanse.

Naalala ko nung 1st term ni Trump, sya din may pakana nung trade war vs China. Ang ending, Vietnam ang pinaka nakinabang dahil yung mga businesses or manufacturers sa mainland China, ipapadala nila sa Vietnam yung mga finished product para lang tapalan ng ""Made in Vietnam"" label para makaligtas sa taripa. Yun ang dahilan bakit sobrang umangat yung Vietnam, to the point na naungusan nila tayo in just half a decade/ 5 years!.

It only grows on certain parts of the world due to climate, so sa kanila Hawaii and maybe PR.  And it takes years to be able to harvest.  Good luck sa kanila to wait that long with no coffee at all.

Part of their states also rely on electricity from Canada.  Fuel is also a big factor, not sure if yung oil rigs nila are enough to sustain the entire country.

And their soybean farms are probably on the verge of collapse.  With the tariff wars going on, China is now doing business with Brazil and South Africa for that instead.  That‚Äôs a huge blow sa America kasi napakalaking export kasi nila to na mawawala sa kanila.

If they ever become ‚Äúself-sustainable‚Äù, their prices will also go way up.  Who do you think is harvesting their food?  Without undocumented workers, they‚Äôll be forced to pay more.  Sa labor pa lang, di na nila masusustain unless they‚Äôll pay Americans more to do shitty jobs they don‚Äôt want to do.

If you don't care about rule of law at all what you can do is draw up the walls around your economy (ie tariffs etc.,)  then you start giving exemptions to those walls as a form of reward for loyalty/political favoritism. Now you get to pick the 'winners' and 'losers' domestically in the economy and you can make it clear that access to wealth flows from you and your faction and nowhere else. 

Once you've got that you have the power to create and destroy economically and you can entrench yourself with a loyal class of cronies who are 'invested' in the new system and whose primary 'expertise' over time will shift to currying political favor rather than running efficient and innovative businesses. They'll know that so they'll help entrench and protect the new crony centric system rather than push for competition. The country as a whole will get poorer, but you and your buds will be very difficult to unseat and your relative power domestically will be extremely high. Any new powers that arise you either coopt into the system or use the system to crush them.

This is extremely bad long term as your country will eventually fall behind other countries with better systems and you'll eventually be too weak to oppose external influence.

ml5ro6w,"I can't recall when it started but the tarrifs was the point where everything went to shit. From what I can remember from history class, there was already a recession in US during the early 1920s. I think 1 in 3 americans were unemployed. The then president signed a bill imposing tariffs on select goods in the hopes that Americans would buy local goods and encourage employment. Lobbyists, wanting a piece of the pie, also managed to convince the president to include pretty much everything.

Since US is an import economy, it backfired. Other nations put a blanket tariff hike on them which cascaded into a global scale.  People panicked and pulled out their stocks further tanking the market.

Trump's plan is the same. The US is still an import economy. They don't even have the infrastructure to support the plan. Americans will never accept a low pay. Local manufacturing is literally unsustainable for them without the cheap labor of immigrants and the cheap raw materials being imported. Kicking out immigrants and putting tariffs on your allies is double tapping yourself on the head.",bad3ip420,1,1743661993.0

And the US can just produce on their own, but they won't, because it's cheaper to import. Trump and the GOP can cry all they want, but that fact cannot be undone by just imposing random tariffs against other countries. The US is a post-industrial developed nation, and other countries will just have lower wages and lower production costs, no matter how much they b\*tch and moan about it.

ml7aknc,">Trump is a businessman and pretty shrewd at that

You obviously don't know the true details about his business history.  He inherited 500 million fron his daddy and would be better off if he had just put it all in the stock market and let it ride.",StoicVoyager,1,1743689180.0

ml5n3qw,"That's fair and square (the same in mainland China, Singapore, and Vietnam), unlike here in the Philippines, where there is a nationality-based discrimination on private land ownership, where only Filipino citizens and corporations are constitutionally allowed to fully own a parcel of land, fee simple, while foreigners are stuck with a 25+25 lease period.",Joseph20102011,1,1743659342.0
ml5rm9m,"Yes the oligarchs. Others are simply mistaken. I‚Äôm talking purely economic realities and not feelings. That being said, of course Filipinos are free to regulate their country as they see fit. However, all actions have consequences. You can‚Äôt complain about these tariffs because Trump is being a protectionist and protectionism is apart of the actual constitution here in a much larger way. Basically I‚Äôm saying the sentiment here, if negative, is largely hypocritical.",Temuj1n2323,1,1743661961.0
ml5svcj,"At some point, the Philippine government, being itself the biggest landowner, may have to sell idle lands that are currently inhabitated by informal settlers in Metros Manila and Cebu to the highest foreign bidder so that it could pay off the ayuda expenditure costs done by the Marcos-Romualdez administration. Ourselves, if we have inherited properties from our parents and grandparents, may be forced to sell them to the highest foreign bigger so that we could use the land sale proceeds to leave the Philippines and settle in a foreign country of choice and live peacefully without being distracted with the Philippine politics.

The new breed of foreign investors and retirees who want to do business or retire in the Philippines are openly vocal through r/Philippines_Expats that they want full ownership of MSMEs and residential lands because they feel that Filipino spouses or business partners are a bunch of ""moochers"" who want ownership shares but doing nothing with the daily business operations.",Joseph20102011,1,1743662718.0

ml4xmg1,"Talk about totally missing the point. Hina ng reading comprehension ah.

It's not the tariff imposed by Trump that's pointless, it trying to make sense of how he arrived at the numbers that is pointless. His tariffs are a big deal because Trump is essentially creating tariffs out of stupid reasons to everyone.",baybum7,3,1743647694.0
