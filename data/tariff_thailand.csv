ml4328d,"> Figured out where these fake tariff rates come from that Trump is claiming. They didn't actually calculate tariff rates + non-tariff barriers, as they say they did. Instead, for every country, they just took our trade deficit with that country and divided it by the country's exports to us.

> So we have a $17.9 billion trade deficit with Indonesia. Its exports to us are $28 billion. $17.9/$28 = 64%, which Trump claims is the tariff rate Indonesia charges us. What extraordinary nonsense this is.

Trump couldn‚Äôt lie straight in bed üôà and they appear to have deliberately conflated trade imbalances with tariffs! üôà

Here‚Äôs what they appear to have done:

Trade deficit (we think that it might be goods and services, but it could be goods only) with country A is US$50 million.

Value of US exports into country A is US$100 million

Trump divides the US$50 million by the US$100 million, and as a percentage that‚Äôs 50%.

Trump then falsely claims that country A is levying a 50% tariff on American goods or goods and services üôà

However the actual effective tariff levied by country A might only be 5%.

Trump then divides the 50% by two to obtain the ‚Äòreciprocal tariff‚Äô of 25%.

But this is not a real reciprocal tariff, because he is conflating tariffs with trade imbalances.

In this example, the real reciprocal tariff would be 5%. Instead, the Trump reciprocal tariff is 25% (a Trump tariff imbalance of 20%).

Note that the Trump tariff imbalances in the table are all in favour of the USA üôà",Brigstocke,3,1743699874.0

If it weren't real how was the foreign policy described above successful for many years (successful enough for every administration both sides of the aisle to continue it, considering it the best option for America) if it weren't real the world would have been chaos since WW2. Only 3 decades between WW1 and WW2, 8 decades and counting with no WW3.

Those sweatshops are a function of American companies seeking to reduce costs (natural for a business) and the American consumers insatiable demand for products. They don't sell barely a percent of the production in those shops locally, it all goes to the top bidder (UK, USA, Australia etc.) In fact previous administrations encouraged diversification from reliance on China and offered incentives to move production literally anywhere else (ofc the companies chose the next cheapest places, again they exist to profit and acted logically) so production moved to neighboring countries with similarly low wages.

Very true, Wall Street don't seem to think it's a fantastic idea. Volatility in standard markets is not an ideal. Why did he tariff countries with a surplus (Australia) and why do Australia's overseas regions (Norfolk Island) have triple the tariff for no reason? Why use a very basic equation to calculate all tariffs rather than assess properly. Even if it is a good idea, the implementation has been shoddy.

I don't think this will happen. Asia particularly seem to be trying to form a bloc and put up a united front, and the stock market also doesn't believe the kowtow is real or futures wouldn't have plunged and remained plunged.

Much of this 'compliance' was to try avoid the tariff in the first place. Rolling over is unlikely, even if the other countries are smaller 3 fronts sunk Rome and 2 did Germany. Rather wild to willingly even take actions that lead to the possibility of opening up a 10+ front economic war.",bling-esketit5,1,1743686462.0

Their influence isnt just big militarily, but also culturally and in media etc. The EU could also be argued to be a major global power, but they seem to have little intested in south east asia.
