I'm not getting a copy and paste.¬†


Also as far as your statement about other brands not having more or better features. Let me correct you.. Let's take a One plus 13 as an example.¬†


6000ma battery
120w fast charging¬†
4500nits
2k screen
8 gen elite¬†
IP69 water proof


or let's take the vivo x200 pro




6000ma battery¬†
Log video (raw)¬†
4500 nits
90w fast charging


Or let's take the Xiaomi 15 ultra¬†


1 inch camera sensor¬†
5400ma battery¬†
10bit LOG raw video¬†
90w fast charging¬†


Your telling me the s25 ultra has better specs than these? üòÇ¬†


If you are, you are seriously deluded and are just justifying whatever Samsung gives.. Samsung could take away all the cameras and put in a 10mp camera and you will still try your best to defend them


Also when a phone claims it's ULTRA or FLAGSHIP, I EXPECT ultra and flagship specs or else I would get a mid range phone¬†


Samsung has used the SAME camera sensor since the s21 ultra¬† Let this sink in your head or are you in denial¬†


""it's m13 plus, not m13""¬† Doesn't matter how you slice it or go around the bushes with it.. IT IS STILL THE OLDER M13. It isn't the NEWER M14 panel. Samsung are giving you older specs not new ones¬†


Also the only thing you mentioned is the new snap dragon 8 elite.. Guess what? EVERY FLAGSHIP from 2025 Is ALSO getting the 8 elite chip combined with all other flagship features I listed.. The s25 ultra has the 8 elite but has nothing else or old specs¬†


vivo, xiaomi, Oppo are all getting the new 8 gen elite . Your whole statement was based on the 8 gen elite. You probably thought the s25 ultra is the only one getting it üòÇ

You can now buy a four year old flagman and it will work well and perform all of the required tasks. All of them have the same technologies: WiFi, Bluetooth, Data storing and  processing. 

But, corporations can't halve the frequency of releases, bcz that would halve profits. 

So they will continue drop to the market wet and uncompleted products with marketing tricks. 

From my personal experience from both sides (Android / Apple), üçè in this matter looks more rediculously - 15 years ago they took the first  place and for all this term they simply resting on their laurels. But, for now, when the market and competitors were miles ahead, Apple just woke up and hastily tried to catch up the race. 

It looks really funny, when the Apple store offered you a phone with: 
- 60 Hz display ... for 800$...in 2025 year? Really? 
- or, for 1400 $ Apple AI ... which doesn't work in the half of the world for now ... And where it works: still the same Siri, which for now is only able to ask ChatGPT ))

My daughter's 5 years old Galaxy Note 20 is able to do more with Gemini (which is supported everywhere).  

From the other side, for now everyone can definitely pick up even the cheapest phone, or old flagman for the third of the price and have all what you need ))",yep annual race phone release stop today big change every model look like hard well fast strong nothing specially different remarkable buy four year old flagrant work well perform require task technology wife bluetoth datum store process corporation frequency release bc would profit continue drop market wet complete product marketing trick personal experience side andros apple matter look ridiculously year ago take first place term simply rest laurel market competitor mile ahead apple wake hastily try catch race look really funny apple store offer phone display year really apple ai work half world work still sir able ask catgut daughter year old galaxy note able remind support everywhere side everyone definitely pick even cheap phone old flagrant third price need

The new Snapdragon 8 Elite will help with the betterment of the current cameras, so they r not gonna be the same as before.
I have killer photos and even more killer videos with s24u, so im excited for the cameras of the s25u. 
Aaand the cameras are not everything in a phone. Ur so beloved Vivo and Xiaomi dont offer me anything else beside ""good cameras"" (they r not even that good), they  dont have even 10% of the features the Samsung have. I will just mention little part of the things they dont have - S pen, Good Lock, Dex, better multitasking and stop here. Just overall the Samsung software is miles ahead.

Also its not the same M13 panel. Yes, its not M14 either, but its gonna be some sort of 13.5 panel, its not gonna be the same as s24u.  Also there will be new Gorilla glas and even better anti reflection, more bright and bigger screen. Thinner bezels and lighter phone.

Samsung cameras haven't been able to catch up to the competition. I personally feel pictures taken on Samsung have too much grain and saturation. Skintones nearly always show too much magenta. The 50/200 megapixel mode is a mess. The displays are awful if you ask me, not being as bright as the competition. And both my S24 and S24U had the famous grain/sandpaper screen, where under about 30% brightness pixels weren't being lit evenly and grain appears on dark areas.

The P9P I have no issues with whatsoever, yet. I am not a gamer on my phone, so its lesser SoC doesn't matter to me. Battery life has been amazing. And dare I say, better than on my S24U. And it even feels snappier (as long as you don't require a gaming phone or need to use all CPU cores at once to say render something). I haven't even felt it getting warm with my usage, which is mainly YouTube, streaming, socials, photography, work related apps and lots of browsing. Gemini is leading, with AI being stamped on everything these days. The camera is way better than I had hoped coming from Samsung and expecting them to have been closer to the competition in photography. 

Downsides for me are the worse sounding speakers on Pixel and I do miss the pen sometimes. The lack of Dolby Atmos support (and Dolby Vision, though not as important) is also ridiculous).",one I though feature rich opinion xvi designer really inconsistent infuriate samson camera able catch competition I personally feel picture take samson much grain situation skintone nearly always show much agent megapixel mode mess display awful ask I bright competition famous grainsandpaper screen brightness pipe light evenly grain appear dark area p I issue whatsoever yet I game phone less matter I battery life amazing dare I say well even feel happy long require gaze phone need use cup come say render something I even feel get warm usage mainly couture stream social photography work relate lot browse remind lead ai stamp everything day camera way well I hope come samson expect close competition photography downside I bad sound speaker fix I miss pen sometimes lack doubt atom support doubt vision though important also ridiculous

This means potentially better battery life for the same workload and capacity, significantly less noticeable stutters, significantly fewer scenarios where the chip would thermal throttle thus leading to consistently lower temperatures, and better longevity if you're holding onto the phone for more than 2 years.

It's the same reason why getting a better engine on a car makes a noticeable difference even if you're not going to drive it faster than you normally would on the road.

Plus I bought a 512GB model, and with trade ins, you never get more value for the extra GB either. Just not worth upgrading in any shape or form.

It will need a major camera spec upgrade. One Plus, Xaomi, all these other companies are making progress. We also don't need 200MP.
