This past Friday morning I woke up and the phone was completely fried, as in dead. It gave me zero warning and something tells me the last security update after at least 4 days would not download as I tried about 10 times.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far. 

The S22 battery Is well documented as being terrible because of its size, and I'm enjoying a lot more battery life and just a different phone which in my mind might as well be Androids flagship. It's solid AF. 
The S series Samsungs are great, but the time had come for a change

But the pixel has much better stuff for like call screening, a much better recorder app. Much quicker updates, a much more interesting beta program. Doesn't use a horizontal app drawer, it's much easier to move apps to the home screen (Samsung forces you to click long press find app and then once again move it).

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher. 

Also Samsung has 60 GB of system storage instead of like 15. The updates are faster in terms of time it takes to accomplish with Samsung but you can't use the phone while it's updating. 

until this year the pixel was also a much better value proposition in terms of price where the pixel 7 pro for instance was $400 less than the s22 ultra and it started with 12 GB of RAM instead of 8 


But frankly both companies have pissed me off in a lot of ways lately.

For instance Pixel finally did add a manual mode to their camera but then don't actually let you use the full resolution of the camera. They just made an update that broke the Pixel 4a for a lot of people and only gave them two days notice and 50 bucks and even then you need to sign up for a financial services company that will charge you 30 bucks a year to use just to get the 50 bucks.",well I think I would say everything I mean many thing particularly desktop mode well performance fix much well stuff like call screen much well recorder much quick update much interesting beta program use horizontal drawer much easy move home screen samson force click long press find move also pipe unlocked botloader samsung say fix launch disappointing remove damn wide even change default search option remove attic alliance main homage wildly nerve manipulate thankful case I usually switch third party launch also samson go system storage instead like update fast term time take accomplish samson use phone date year fix also much well value proposition term price fix pro instance less ultra start go ram instead frankly company pass I lot way lately instance fix finally add manual mode camera actually let use full resolution camera make update break fix lot people give two day notice buck even need sign financial service company charge buck year use get buck

The Snapdragon chip inside is just objectively way more powerful. Google does come out on top with photos. Though, I'd say Samsung's cameras are still really good and competitive with Pixel and iPhones even if they're not upgrading the camera hardware as frequently as they used to. There's plenty to criticize Samsung about in terms of not doing enough to upgrade their phones from year to year, but the Ultra is still one of the best phones on the market right now. Especially if we're talking the NA market where there aren't really any of the Chinese phones to choose from. Not to mention, OneUI is the best version of Android right now. Super customizable with GoodLock, too.

I'm considering upgrading my S23 Ultra to the S25 Ultra even though there aren't *huge* improvements in a ton of areas. Samsung's trade offers, the free storage upgrade, etc. are good deals and are tempting me. I can get the phone for $550 with 512 GB of storage. If I wait for the S26 Ultra, it's likely my S23 Ultra will only be worth $500 or less instead of the $750 being offered for it now. That's not to say I don't have criticisms, but I'd take Samsung over a Pixel any day.",especially ultra well snapdragon chip inside objective way powerful goose come top photo though I would say samsung camera still really good competitive fix phone even upbraid camera hardware frequently use plenty criticize samson term enough upgrade phone year year ultra still one well phone market right especially talk na market really chinese phone choose mention one well version andros right super customizable wedlock I consider upbraid ultra ultra even though huge improvement ton area samsung trade offer free storage upgrade etc good deal tempt I I get phone go storage I wait ultra likely ultra worth less instead offer say I criticism I would take samson fix day

It's bad enough that third party launcher developers including the ones you listed all jointly wrote a letter asking Android to fix these things. 

All of that said I find him to be barely noticeable if at all noticeable. It's not like Android 10 when sometimes jesters would break entirely with third party launchers. 

And even then that was resolved by just turning button control on and then turning gestures back on. 

But yes if I'm using a Samsung phone or a Pixel phone 2025 I'm changing to a third party launcher for 80% of my use. 


So I do think the complaints are wildly exaggerated at times but they certainly exist since Niagara launchers developers have now organized to try to have them fixed

In one corner we Samsung who is the king, unthreathened a year anyone while selling very very very iterative and repeat phones without really pushing Android further. The S25 series is the perfect example of this. Even the S24 series in Europe proved this too as the S24 & S24+ ship with a vastly inferior chip than what other flagships offer.


Then we have Google, held back by the Tensor. The owners of Android can't/won't offer a device with flagship performance,  or at least a device that's priced to match. Their cameras are seriously good, and Google has a good thing with the design and software. But performance sucks. Period. I never had as bad of performance in Firefox than i did on my Pixel  7Pro. Even the S21U was smooth.

So now shit is stagnant.

In which case maybe you're happy about the throttling. But I would argue there should be a high performance mode in the settings at least and that people should be aware that they're battery life is improved because of throttling. 

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated. Frankly I actually think 8g2 is a better trip than 8g3 and 8g4 (whatever it's called now) because when you see honest testing of the better you find out that both of those require more power on their sustained load.

That's why we're seeing so many bigger batteries this year although the difference was not very drastic 8g3 

Likewise I thought the 865 chip was way better than 888 8g1.",right honestly like people might care throttle use high performance software like case maybe happy throttle I would argue high performance mode setting least people aware battery life improve throttle like samson remove high performance mode start get praise increase battery life yeah pay increase battery life diminish performance okay might want seriously consider look midrange device save money necessarily maybe want flagship camera design long update I agree something achieve matter matter everybody certainly throttle example list I necessarily care senior outdate I even care chip outdate frankly I actually think g well trip g g whatever call see honest testing well find require power sustain load see many big battery year although difference drastic g likewise I think chip way well g

Even today I came across a bug where pixel settings was not allowing me to change wallpapers. And like you said, you can't even remove the widget.

 Also, the amount of space is wasted on the home screen is just mind boggling. At least give the option to adjust grid sizes but nope. 

The camera performance is excellent in Pixel but then the UI? It feels like that UI was developed by a uni fresher making something for his HCI101 project. It's so bad, if you need to adjust exposure you have to press 3 buttons to adjust exposure lol. In early pixels it was just a simple intuitive slide, similar to how iOS camera interface is. But now it's just garbage, don't know how something like that gets approval from Google of all company. I expect polished software experience from a mega corp like Google.

Honestly I think there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones 

I won't repeat all the criticisms for the s25 since at this point they're well known but I am normally a pixel user and I love the new design ever since the Pixel 6.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals 

I am really excited to see what TSMC will do to the pixels but if you didn't like the Pixel 8 pro it's bizarre that everyone like the Pixel 9 pro. It seems like it's just bc it looks more like an iPhone 

I would much rather have the pixel 8 pro and you can find it for 350 bucks on Amazon renewed.",scrutinize consumer report honestly I think plenty criticism phone I repeat criticism since point well know I normally fix user I love new design ever since fix I frustrate year seem opinion least north america couture double standard pipe I think coverage unfair strange medium opinion turn fix device since internal functional identical silicon still samson time yet performance barely different old device functional difference square design cost money year row price increase case fix pro go model get fix pro still go storage inferior samson internal I really excite see time pipe like fix pro bizarre everyone like fix pro seem like bc look like phone I would much rather fix pro find buck amazon renew

1. The Pixel 4a5g was the first non super budget phone I owned and it wowed me. So I stuck with Pixel.¬†


2. Google's Pixel products and ecosystem are necessary to keep Apple in check.

All of that said from the user experience I do not notice any complaints with it. I do recall with Android 10 sometimes The gestures would break on some devices but on newer models whatever limitations they have to the animations I do not notice. 

Maybe it's bc I turn animations down to .5

Whatever the limitations are I find Nova launcher to be way better than both the home screen for the Pixel or the one UI. Like you can't customize gestures on those or resize the grid beyond a few presets.

Pixel launcher is probably the most obnoxious in terms of not being able to remove the widgets but Samsung has the worst app drawer in the game at least out of all the phones I've used. And the vertical app drawer available in good lock is not good either.

The S24 is very sharp, and leaves an imprint on your pinky of you use it to hold the phone up at the bottom. It makes a case mandatory. Which reduces that difference in width even more.

And they've already contracted TSMC to make the new ones while Samsung is now having to move mediatek. So it's going to be funny when Samsung fans have to turn around and say performance doesn't matter in a couple years. 

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance. But when the Pixel 6 came out they were competing against the 888 which was also fabricated by Samsung and a complete s*** show. Pixel 7 pro came out it was competing against 8g1... Also fabricated by Samsung and also a complete s*** show. 


So honestly the performance doesn't bother me what bothers me is the constant price increases, the stupid AI b*******.

But you get an unlocked bootloader and a much better beta program and a much better camera. 

I just I don't know why people are so solely focused on the performance of the chip when Android OS is such that the performance of the chip doesn't really matter.

""What can you accomplish with a phone now that you couldn't accomplish with a phone that's 4 years old.""

So at least in the short term Android is the bottleneck not these chips. 

I mean it's frankly barely makes a difference whether you have a phone with an 865 or an 8g3. And that's like 5 years apart and I genuinely can't think of why One thing I couldn't do on the 865 that I would want to do. 

But pixel will improve when they switch TSMC. The worst part about Pixel phones are all the Samsung internals ironically

But pixel has a lot of benefits over Samsung including no bloat, unlocked bootloader, faster shutter speed, better camera, better voice recording app. ... Way less proprietary stuff. For instance Samsung notes doesn't work on a Windows laptop that isn't a Galaxy book anymore. 


I don't think there's a winner here. Both of these companies are engaging in pretty anti-consumer s***. I think Pixel deserved a little more of a benefit of the doubt with the Pixel 6 and 7 when they were undercutting Samsung's pricing considerably. The Pixel 7 pro for instance was a solid $400 cheaper than the s22 ultra and $100 cheaper than the s22 Plus which only had a 1080p screen.

Most people don't need more power than a tensor, sure, but that's mid-range to low range territory where a phone should cost less than 500.

The difference in power between the snapdragon 8 elite and a Google tensor chip is literally a 3 or 4 generation difference in performance, if not more. It's completely fine to say pixels are powerful enough for 90% of people (they probably are), but it's not ok to brush aside the price they charge. Simply put, you're paying for 4 year old technology as if it's bleeding edge and just because it's not immediately apparent, a lot of people brush it off.

Again, it's totally fine if a consumer KNOWS they are getting a mid-range chip and still chooses to pay for a pixel, there's plenty to love about them.

Some people must be really sensitive to the animations or something because I never have any (noticeable) bugs on third party launchers with pixels or with Samsung for that matter. Outside of Android 10.

Maybe it's b. I turn animations down to .5 anyways but to me I don't notice it at

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI. 

Like the fact that you can't customize launchers on either of the stock launchers right there is reason enough for me to switch to Nova. 

Double tapping for my remote control or swiping up and down on icons for shortcuts should be available on every these devices.",I use third party launch pipe I find problem people must really sensitive animation something I never noticeable bag third party launch pipe samson matter outside andros maybe b I turn animation anyway I I notice I say exist I know new version andros restrict launch ability access certain axis I nova launch great experience fix way well stock launch I would say thing samson although I hear exact opposite thing fact I explicitly read article explain nova launch work well pipe samson case whatever bag limitation exist I find third party launch like nova way well one I fix home screen I know third party launch organize try get access animation thing control I think andros could hospitable launch I know user experience way superior fix launch one I like fact customize launch either stock launch right reason enough I switch nova double tap remote control wipe icon shortcut available every device
