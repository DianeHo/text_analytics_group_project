> The key new features include the A18 chip, which provides enhanced performance and supports Apple Intelligence, faster charging, the Action Button, an enhanced ultra wide camera with support for macro photography, revamped Photographic Styles, and the all-new Camera Control button.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 retains a similar design to the iPhone 15. The color palette has become more vibrant, with options like Ultramarine, Pink, and Teal. The camera arrangement has also been redesigned, moving from the previous diagonal layout to a vertical stack, a change that helps enable Spatial Video and Photo capture for the Vision Pro headset.

> Among the standout additions to the ‌iPhone‌ 16 is the introduction of the Action Button and the Camera Control. Previously exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro, the Action Button is a customizable button that replaces the traditional mute switch, offering users flexibility to assign various functions such as starting voice memos or launching shortcuts. Meanwhile, the new Camera Control capacitive button, located on the right side of the device, takes smartphone photography to the next level by mimicking a physical shutter button. It also integrates gestures for adjusting settings like zoom, exposure, and more.

> One of the ‌iPhone‌ 16's key features is support for Apple Intelligence. While many of these features are still on the way with future software updates, the A18 chip underpins the phone's ability to handle the AI tools, offering improvements in performance, battery efficiency, and overall user experience.

> The ‌iPhone‌ 16 brings several key camera upgrades, including an improved ultra wide camera, with support for macro photography for the first time on a standard ‌iPhone‌ model.

I'm not getting a copy and paste. 


Also as far as your statement about other brands not having more or better features. Let me correct you.. Let's take a One plus 13 as an example. 


6000ma battery
120w fast charging 
4500nits
2k screen
8 gen elite 
IP69 water proof


or let's take the vivo x200 pro




6000ma battery 
Log video (raw) 
4500 nits
90w fast charging


Or let's take the Xiaomi 15 ultra 


1 inch camera sensor 
5400ma battery 
10bit LOG raw video 
90w fast charging 


Your telling me the s25 ultra has better specs than these? 😂 


If you are, you are seriously deluded and are just justifying whatever Samsung gives.. Samsung could take away all the cameras and put in a 10mp camera and you will still try your best to defend them


Also when a phone claims it's ULTRA or FLAGSHIP, I EXPECT ultra and flagship specs or else I would get a mid range phone 


Samsung has used the SAME camera sensor since the s21 ultra  Let this sink in your head or are you in denial 


""it's m13 plus, not m13""  Doesn't matter how you slice it or go around the bushes with it.. IT IS STILL THE OLDER M13. It isn't the NEWER M14 panel. Samsung are giving you older specs not new ones 


Also the only thing you mentioned is the new snap dragon 8 elite.. Guess what? EVERY FLAGSHIP from 2025 Is ALSO getting the 8 elite chip combined with all other flagship features I listed.. The s25 ultra has the 8 elite but has nothing else or old specs 


vivo, xiaomi, Oppo are all getting the new 8 gen elite . Your whole statement was based on the 8 gen elite. You probably thought the s25 ultra is the only one getting it 😂

And they've already contracted TSMC to make the new ones while Samsung is now having to move mediatek. So it's going to be funny when Samsung fans have to turn around and say performance doesn't matter in a couple years. 

But anyways, the reason I'm not so infatuated with performances cuz the bottleneck is Android. Can run any game at their maximum frame rates with an 865 chip. What exactly do the newer chips enable you to do that you couldn't do with an older chip? 


The only reason it's an issue in my opinion is thermal and battery performance. But when the Pixel 6 came out they were competing against the 888 which was also fabricated by Samsung and a complete s*** show. Pixel 7 pro came out it was competing against 8g1... Also fabricated by Samsung and also a complete s*** show. 


So honestly the performance doesn't bother me what bothers me is the constant price increases, the stupid AI b*******.

But you get an unlocked bootloader and a much better beta program and a much better camera. 

I just I don't know why people are so solely focused on the performance of the chip when Android OS is such that the performance of the chip doesn't really matter. 


I mean this is the same with iPhones. There's functionally no noticeable difference between using the a16 versus the a13. Not to the end user. Where it matters I suppose is the long-term arc of development but for the short-term user it means almost nothing.",definitely weak spot ironically use samson internal already contract time make new one samson move mediate go funny samson fan turn around say performance matter couple year anyway reason I infatuate performance cut bottleneck andros run game maximum frame rate chip exactly new chip enable could old chip reason issue opinion thermal battery performance fix come compete also abdicate samson complete show fix pro come compete g also abdicate samson also complete show honestly performance bother I I constant price increase stupid ai b get unlocked botloader much well beta program much well camera I I know people solely focus performance chip andros os performance chip really matter I mean phone functional noticeable difference use versus end user matter I suppose long arc development short user mean almost nothing

Some people must be really sensitive to the animations or something because I never have any (noticeable) bugs on third party launchers with pixels or with Samsung for that matter. Outside of Android 10.

Maybe it's b. I turn animations down to .5 anyways but to me I don't notice it at

I'm not saying they don't exist, I know newer versions of Android do restrict the launcher's ability to have access to certain APIs. But to me Nova launcher is a great experience on a pixel.  Way better than the stock launcher. And I would say the same thing about Samsung. 

Although I've heard the exact opposite thing you did in fact I explicitly read an article that explained why Nova launcher works better on pixels than it does on Samsung. 

But in both cases, whatever bugs and limitations exist, I find third party launchers like Nova to be way better than one UI or the pixel home screen.

But I do know all of these third party launchers are organizing to try to get more access to animations and other things that they cannot control. So I do think Android could be more hospitable to launchers I just know from my user experience then they are way superior to the pixel launcher or one UI. 

Like the fact that you can't customize launchers on either of the stock launchers right there is reason enough for me to switch to Nova.

 Also, the amount of space is wasted on the home screen is just mind boggling. At least give the option to adjust grid sizes but nope. 

The camera performance is excellent in Pixel but then the UI? It feels like that UI was developed by a uni fresher making something for his HCI101 project. It's so bad, if you need to adjust exposure you have to press 3 buttons to adjust exposure lol. In early pixels it was just a simple intuitive slide, similar to how iOS camera interface is. But now it's just garbage, don't know how something like that gets approval from Google of all company. I expect polished software experience from a mega corp like Google.

Most people don't need more power than a tensor, sure, but that's mid-range to low range territory where a phone should cost less than 500.

The difference in power between the snapdragon 8 elite and a Google tensor chip is literally a 3 or 4 generation difference in performance, if not more. It's completely fine to say pixels are powerful enough for 90% of people (they probably are), but it's not ok to brush aside the price they charge. Simply put, you're paying for 4 year old technology as if it's bleeding edge and just because it's not immediately apparent, a lot of people brush it off.

Again, it's totally fine if a consumer KNOWS they are getting a mid-range chip and still chooses to pay for a pixel, there's plenty to love about them. But as consumers, we shouldn't gaslight our fellow consumers that they're not overpaying or that they aren't receiving a mid-range product for $1000+. Pixels are niche compared to other brands so of course there will be a premium, but they're wildly overcharging people.

Makes sense... Pixel 10. It's a nice milestone. But they're leaving Samsung for TSMC and finally dropping to 3nm. It'll still lag behind but I read the upgrade for the 11 will actually close the gap. 


But for me the G4 is fine. I don't play video games on my phone outside of really simple ones like card games or Head Ball 2. I use my phone for a lot of basic things...internet browsing (not on Firefox), texting, phone calls, dating apps, as an alarm, and the occasional conversation with Irish Gemini...and I haven't had any issues. I guess some websites may not load as fast, but I have the extra second to spare. But bash Google for being lazy. It's a smart phone.

It's bad enough that third party launcher developers including the ones you listed all jointly wrote a letter asking Android to fix these things. 

All of that said I find him to be barely noticeable if at all noticeable. It's not like Android 10 when sometimes jesters would break entirely with third party launchers. 

And even then that was resolved by just turning button control on and then turning gestures back on. 

But yes if I'm using a Samsung phone or a Pixel phone 2025 I'm changing to a third party launcher for 80% of my use.

1. The Pixel 4a5g was the first non super budget phone I owned and it wowed me. So I stuck with Pixel. 


2. Google's Pixel products and ecosystem are necessary to keep Apple in check. With Google owning Android, they're pure Android os approach, and investment in AI allows for Apple users to switch to Android without too much of a learning curve. It's growing market share...along with multiple government lawsuits....is forcing Apple to open up their locked ecosystem. It'll slowly keep opening up.

The S24 is very sharp, and leaves an imprint on your pinky of you use it to hold the phone up at the bottom. It makes a case mandatory. Which reduces that difference in width even more.

Honestly I think there's plenty of criticism for both of these phones 

I won't repeat all the criticisms for the s25 since at this point they're well known but I am normally a pixel user and I love the new design ever since the Pixel 6.

I was frustrated these years seem in my opinion at least in North America YouTube a double standard were pixels. I thought the coverage was unfair.

It's strange that the media opinion has turned with the Pixel 9 of all devices since the internals are functionally identical. The silicon is still on Samsung and not TSMC yet. Performance is barely different at all from the older devices. 

Functionally the only difference is that it is square design now and it cost more money 

2 years in a row they had price increases. In the case of the Pixel 7 pro it was $960 for the 256 GB model and now it's $240 more to get that Pixel 9 pro XL MSRP. Still with 128 GB of storage and the same inferior Samsung internals 

I am really excited to see what TSMC will do to the pixels but if you didn't like the Pixel 8 pro it's bizarre that everyone like the Pixel 9 pro. It seems like it's just bc it looks more like an iPhone 

I would much rather have the pixel 8 pro and you can find it for 350 bucks on Amazon renewed.",scrutinize consumer report honestly I think plenty criticism phone I repeat criticism since point well know I normally fix user I love new design ever since fix I frustrate year seem opinion least north america couture double standard pipe I think coverage unfair strange medium opinion turn fix device since internal functional identical silicon still samson time yet performance barely different old device functional difference square design cost money year row price increase case fix pro go model get fix pro still go storage inferior samson internal I really excite see time pipe like fix pro bizarre everyone like fix pro seem like bc look like phone I would much rather fix pro find buck amazon renew

But the pixel has much better stuff for like call screening, a much better recorder app. Much quicker updates, a much more interesting beta program. Doesn't use a horizontal app drawer, it's much easier to move apps to the home screen (Samsung forces you to click long press find app and then once again move it).

Also pixels have unlocked bootloaders and most Samsungs do not 

All of that said, The pixel launcher can be very disappointing because you can't remove that damn widget or even change the default search option in. You can't remove the attic alliance so your main homepage is wildly nerfed in how you can manipulate it. 

Thankfully in both cases I'll usually switch to a third party launcher. 

Also Samsung has 60 GB of system storage instead of like 15. The updates are faster in terms of time it takes to accomplish with Samsung but you can't use the phone while it's updating. 

until this year the pixel was also a much better value proposition in terms of price where the pixel 7 pro for instance was $400 less than the s22 ultra and it started with 12 GB of RAM instead of 8 


But frankly both companies have pissed me off in a lot of ways lately.

For instance Pixel finally did add a manual mode to their camera but then don't actually let you use the full resolution of the camera. They just made an update that broke the Pixel 4a for a lot of people and only gave them two days notice and 50 bucks and even then you need to sign up for a financial services company that will charge you 30 bucks a year to use just to get the 50 bucks.",well I think I would say everything I mean many thing particularly desktop mode well performance fix much well stuff like call screen much well recorder much quick update much interesting beta program use horizontal drawer much easy move home screen samson force click long press find move also pipe unlocked botloader samsung say fix launch disappointing remove damn wide even change default search option remove attic alliance main homage wildly nerve manipulate thankful case I usually switch third party launch also samson go system storage instead like update fast term time take accomplish samson use phone date year fix also much well value proposition term price fix pro instance less ultra start go ram instead frankly company pass I lot way lately instance fix finally add manual mode camera actually let use full resolution camera make update break fix lot people give two day notice buck even need sign financial service company charge buck year use get buck

The 50/200 megapixel mode is a mess. The displays are awful if you ask me, not being as bright as the competition. And both my S24 and S24U had the famous grain/sandpaper screen, where under about 30% brightness pixels weren't being lit evenly and grain appears on dark areas.

The P9P I have no issues with whatsoever, yet. I am not a gamer on my phone, so its lesser SoC doesn't matter to me. Battery life has been amazing. And dare I say, better than on my S24U. And it even feels snappier (as long as you don't require a gaming phone or need to use all CPU cores at once to say render something). I haven't even felt it getting warm with my usage, which is mainly YouTube, streaming, socials, photography, work related apps and lots of browsing. Gemini is leading, with AI being stamped on everything these days. The camera is way better than I had hoped coming from Samsung and expecting them to have been closer to the competition in photography.

Maybe it's bc I turn animations down to .5

Whatever the limitations are I find Nova launcher to be way better than both the home screen for the Pixel or the one UI. Like you can't customize gestures on those or resize the grid beyond a few presets.

Pixel launcher is probably the most obnoxious in terms of not being able to remove the widgets but Samsung has the worst app drawer in the game at least out of all the phones I've used. And the vertical app drawer available in good lock is not good either.

But pixel has a lot of benefits over Samsung including no bloat, unlocked bootloader, faster shutter speed, better camera, better voice recording app. ... Way less proprietary stuff. For instance Samsung notes doesn't work on a Windows laptop that isn't a Galaxy book anymore. 


I don't think there's a winner here. Both of these companies are engaging in pretty anti-consumer s***. I think Pixel deserved a little more of a benefit of the doubt with the Pixel 6 and 7 when they were undercutting Samsung's pricing considerably. The Pixel 7 pro for instance was a solid $400 cheaper than the s22 ultra and $100 cheaper than the s22 Plus which only had a 1080p screen.

This past Friday morning I woke up and the phone was completely fried, as in dead. It gave me zero warning and something tells me the last security update after at least 4 days would not download as I tried about 10 times.

Short story longer, I was in a rush to get a working phone and ended up with a Pixel 9 after being offered the S24 Ultra. The S24 was too large for my needs, and without really any research went with the Pixel 9 base.
I left the store with a little bit of a sinking feeling if you will...

So now after 6 days, I'm digging this Pixel 9 a ton.
It may be just because moving from Samsung to Google is giving me a different experience, which is a better experience So far. 

The S22 battery Is well documented as being terrible because of its size, and I'm enjoying a lot more battery life and just a different phone which in my mind might as well be Androids flagship. It's solid AF.

It's like when Samsung removed their high performance mode and started getting praised for increased battery life. 

Yeah but you're paying for that increase battery life in diminished performance. If that's okay with you you might want to seriously consider looking into mid-range devices and saving yourself money. 

Not necessarily maybe you want the flagship because of the camera or the design or the longer updates but I do agree that how something is achieved can matter. 

It doesn't matter to everybody but it's certainly does in the throttling example you listed. 

But I don't necessarily care if the sensor is outdated. I don't even care if the chip is outdated. Frankly I actually think 8g2 is a better trip than 8g3 and 8g4 (whatever it's called now) because when you see honest testing of the better you find out that both of those require more power on their sustained load.
