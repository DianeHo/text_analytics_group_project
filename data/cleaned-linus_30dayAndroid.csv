mke2f0f,"When I switched for 2 months to an Android phone (for everything besides banking apps) my main gripe was that the apps just work worse in generally. They feel less polished, less intuitive and less consistent.  
Consistency is generally an issue with Android since there are so many options.

But I don't know why losing iMessage is an issue, in my circles it's about 50/50 but nobody has a flagship Android from the last couple years. We just use anything but SMS/iMessage, especially using iMessage is well a mess because the default settings don't let you send a message to an Android user and automatically convert that to SMS.

Generally it's a preference thing, but there is something to be said about an ecosystem. And that ecosystem is even pretty good when you only buy a new phone very x years and you can seamlessly switch over.",Business-Dream-6362,52,1743271304.0,I switch month andros phone everything besides banking main grip work bad generally feel less polish less intuition less consistent consistency generally issue andros since many option I know lose message issue circle nobody flagship andros last couple year use anything smsimesage especially use message well mess default setting let send message andros user automatically convert sum generally preference thing something say ecosystem ecosystem even pretty good buy new phone x year seamlesly switch

mkebm5g,"I've been using an iPhone 15 for 1 year because I always heard that the grass is greener on the other side, and in my experience the grass is *not* greener on the other side.

Now don't get me wrong, the iPhone 15 is a *fine* phone, but for its price, being *fine* is not good enough.

There isn't anything that's a big deal breaker on the phone, but there are so many tiny paper cuts that end up being a frustrating experience to me, to the point that I'm looking at buying a new Android phone.

Some of my tiny paper cuts are:

* You can't install the same app twice on your phone, this is a amazing if you have apps that you want to login into a personal and another into a business account.
* I *hate* that the only browser you can use is Safari, and Safari reskins, so if a website does not work correctly on Safari, you can just sit ft. cry.
* I prefer on screen buttons compared to gestures. Gestures are cool, but I hate when you try doing a gesture and because you didn't move your hand *enough*, nothing happens.
* There aren't ways to install apps from outside of the App Store (except if you live in the EU)
* There are apps that I want to use that aren't available (like Parsec) because Apple doesn't want to. They did improve this a bit by letting emulators on the App Store (without JIT) but that's still not enough.
* On Android, if you want to show a video to someone and you have rotation lock enabled, when rotating to landscape Android shows a button that, when clicked, makes the phone rotate even with rotation lock enabled. On iPhone this doesn't exist and requires you to disable rotation lock manually.
* Face ID, when it works, works pretty dang well, but when it doesn't it sucks because you need to wait until Face ID times out (which sometimes takes 2+ seconds), especially when you *know* it is not going to work and there isn't any way to bypass it.
* People say that iOS is super polished, but I literally was able to find a bug on my FIRST DAY using it! If you switch your homescreen wallpaper, the wallpaper for some reason will be a bit desaturated until you restart your phone, and this issue, as far as I know, has not been fixed yet.

I just end up feeling like my phone is not *mine*.

But then again, compared to the video, I'm not on the Apple eco system (except my AirPods Pro, which IMO it is an amazing device), so which is maybe why I don't have any of the niceties of being inside of their eco system.",MrPowerGamerBR,9,1743274298.0,I use phone year I always hear grass greene side experience grass greene side get I wrong phone fine phone price fine good enough anything big deal breaker phone many tiny paper cut end frustration experience I point I look buy new andros phone tiny paper cut install twice phone amazing want login personal another business account I hate brother use salary salary remain webster work correctly salary sit ft cry I prefer screen button compare gesture gesture cool I hate try gesture move hand enough nothing happen way install outside store except live e I want use available like pass apple want improve bit let emulator store without still enough andros want show video someone rotation lock enable rotate landscape andros show button click make phone rotate even rotation lock enable phone exist require disable rotation lock mentally face I work work pretty sing well suck need wait face I time sometimes take second especially know go work way pass people say super polish I literally able find bug first day use switch homescren wallpaper wallpaper reason bit saturate start phone issue far I know fix yet I end feel like phone mine compare video I apple co system except airport pro mio amazing device maybe I nicety inside co system

Edit: I don't know if this is on other Android phones, but on mine, it specifically tells you the gestures when you set them, and shows an animation for the gestures. Since this tells Android users the gesture equivalents of buttons, it would be helpful for knowing them.

mkf6szr,">Yeah it works, hell you can plug a cable directly and transfer files full speed between android and iPhone, but that’s not the point, the point is that AirDrop is standard

Fair, but that's honestly caused by Google incompetence or lack of understanding the problems rather than lack of standards. And Google at least already tackles the issues of messaging with RCS, but none whatsoever with file sharing even though technically speaking it's easier (and already implemented by some indies developer).

What Google did with Nearby Share is just insane. Google makes it confusing (as usual), rarely advertises it (again, as usual), needs to use a Google account (why?), and for some reason including Bluetooth and Internet as fallback methods (which sucks and greatly worsen the experience). It's also incompatible with iOS.

Meanwhile using Localsend is as easy as using AirDrop on Apple Devices.
 

>Another thing is with AirDrop files immediately go where they need to go. Send a photo, goes straight to gallery, send a text note, goes to the notes app.
